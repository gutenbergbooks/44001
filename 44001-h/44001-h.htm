<h2><a name="Foreword" id="Foreword">Foreword</a></h2>

<p>On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Executive Order
No. 11130, creating a Commission "to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the
facts relating to the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy and
the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination." By
the same Executive order, the President appointed seven Commissioners: Earl
Warren, Chief Justice of the United States; Richard B. Russell, Democratic
Senator from Georgia; John Sherman Cooper, Republican Senator from Kentucky;
Hale Boggs, Democratic Congressman from Louisiana and House Majority
Whip; Gerald R. Ford, Republican Congressman from Michigan; Allen W.
Dulles, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and John J. McCloy,
former High Commissioner of Germany. The President designated Chief Justice
Warren as the Commission's Chairman. The findings of the Commission, based
on an examination of all the facts, are set forth in the separate volume entitled
"Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy."</p>

<p>An essential part of the investigation conducted by this Commission has been
the securing of sworn testimony from witnesses possessing information relevant
to the inquiry. This testimony has been taken under the authority of Senate
Joint Resolution 137 (88th Cong., 1st sess.), enacted by Congress on December
13, 1963, which conferred upon the Commission the power to administer oaths
and affirmations, examine witnesses, receive evidence, and issue subpenas.
Under the procedures adopted by the Commission, some witnesses have appeared
before members of the Commission, others have been questioned under oath
on depositions by members of the staff, and others have provided affidavits to
the Commission. Beginning with its first witness on February 3, 1964, the
Commission under these procedures took the testimony of approximately 550
witnesses and received more than 3,100 exhibits into evidence.</p>

<p>The testimony and exhibits obtained by the Commission are printed in this
and the succeeding volumes, organized in the following order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testimony before members of the Commission, in the order in which
it was taken.</p>

<p class="hang">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testimony by sworn deposition or affidavit, grouped into four general
subject categories; the medical attention given to the President and
the Governor, identification of the assassin of President Kennedy,
the background of Lee Harvey Oswald, and the killing of Lee Harvey
Oswald by Jack L. Ruby on November 24, 1963.</p>

<p class="hang">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibits introduced in connection with the testimony before the
Commission in numerical order.</p>

<p class="hang">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibits introduced in connection with sworn depositions and affidavits,
grouped alphabetically by name of witness.</p>

<p class="hang">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other exhibits introduced before the Commission in numerical order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The transcripts of this testimony, prepared by qualified court reporters, were
reviewed by members of the Commission staff and, in most instances, by the
witness concerned. Editing of the transcript prior to printing in these volumes
was confined to correction of stenographic errors and punctuation, and minor
changes designed to improve the clarity and accuracy of the testimony. In the
few cases indicated, brief deletions have been made of material which might
be considered in poor taste and is clearly irrelevant to any facet of the Commission's
investigation. All the original transcripts prepared by the court reporters,
of course, have been preserved and will be available for inspection under the
same rules and regulations which will apply to all records of this Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Each volume contains a brief preface discussing the contents of the volume.
In addition, each volume of testimony contains a table of contents with the
names of the witnesses whose testimony appears in the volume, and the numbers
of the exhibits introduced in connection with that testimony. Each volume of
exhibits contains a table of contents with short descriptions of the exhibits
reproduced in the volume. Volume XV contains a name index setting forth all
references to persons (other than Lee Harvey Oswald) appearing in the Hearings
volumes and an index setting forth all references to Commission exhibits and
Deposition exhibits in these volumes.</p>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10:35 a.m. on February 3, 1964, at 200
Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman
Cooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and Allen
W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; John M. Thorne, attorney
for Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald; William D. Krimer and Leon I. Gopadze, interpreters.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mrs. Oswald, did you have a good trip here?</p>

<p>The Commission will come to order, and at this time, I will make a short
statement for the purpose of the meeting. A copy of this statement has been
given to counsel for Mrs. Oswald, but for the record, I should like to read it.</p>

<p>On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order
No. 11130 appointing a Commission "to ascertain, evaluate, and report upon the
facts relating to the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy, and
the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination."</p>

<p>On December 13, 1963, Congress adopted Joint Resolution S.J. 137 which
authorizes the Commission, or any member of the Commission or any agent or
agency designated by the Commission for such purpose to administer oaths and
affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, excuse me, the <span class="locked">interpreter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I understood they have a copy and if they want to at the end
he may do that.</p>

<p>On January 21, 1964, the Commission adopted a resolution authorizing each
member of the Commission and its General Counsel, J. Lee Rankin, to administer
oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence concerning any
matter under investigation by the Commission.</p>

<p>The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mrs. Marina Oswald,
the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald who, prior to his death, was charged with the
assassination of President Kennedy. Since the Commission is inquiring fully
into the background of Lee Harvey Oswald and those associated with him, it is
the intention of the Commission to ask Mrs. Marina Oswald questions concerning
Lee Harvey Oswald and any and all matters relating to the assassination.
The Commission also intends to ask Mrs. Marina Oswald questions
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent
death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marina Oswald has been furnished with a copy of this statement and a
copy of the rules adopted by the Commission for the taking of testimony or the
production of evidence. Mrs. Marina Oswald has also been furnished with a
copy of Executive Order No. 11130 and Congressional Resolution S.J. Res. 137
which set forth the general scope of the Commission's inquiry and its authority
for the examining witnesses and the receiving of evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you have an attorney, a lawyer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And your lawyer is Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. He is the only lawyer you wish to represent you here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And may I ask you, Mr. Thorne, if you have received a copy
of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, that is the copy he received there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. I have read a copy of it, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Are there any questions about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. There are no questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Very well, we will proceed to swear Mrs. Oswald as a witness.</p>

<p>Will you please rise, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>(The Chairman administered the oath to the witness, Mrs. Oswald, through
the interpreter.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Reporter, will you rise, please, and be sworn.</p>

<p>(The Chairman administered the oath to the interpreter and the stenotype
reporter, following which all questions propounded to the witness and her
answers thereto, were duly translated through the interpreter.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Now, Mr. Thorne and Mrs. Oswald, I want to say to you
that we want to see that Mrs. Oswald's rights are protected in every manner and
you are entitled to converse with her at any time that you desire. You are
entitled to give her any advice that you want, either openly or in private; if you
feel that her rights are not being protected you are entitled to object to the
Commission and have a ruling upon it, and at the conclusion of her testimony
if you have any questions that you would like to ask her in verification of
what she has said you may feel free to ask them.</p>

<p>After her testimony has been completed, a copy will be furnished to you so
that if there are any errors, corrections or omissions you may call it to our
attention, is that satisfactory to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Very satisfactory, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I might say also to her we propose to ask her questions for
about 1 hour, and then take a short recess for her refreshment, and then we will
convene again until about 12:30. At 12:30 we will recess until 2 o'clock, and
then we may take her to her hotel where she can see her baby and have a little
rest, and we will return at 2 o'clock, and we will take evidence until about 4:30.
If at any time otherwise you should feel tired or feel that you need a rest, you
may feel free to say so and we will take care of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The questions will be asked of you by Mr. J. Lee Rankin,
who is the general counsel of the Commission.</p>

<p>I think now we are ready to proceed, are we not, Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you be at your ease, and the interpreter will tell
you what I ask and you take your time about your answers.</p>

<p>Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina, my name is Marina Nikolaevna Oswald. My maiden
name was Prussakova.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where do you live, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the present time I live in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Thorne knows my address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. 11125 Ferrar Street, Dallas, Dallas County, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you live with friends there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I live with Mr. Jim Martin and his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you have a family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have two children, two girls, June will be 2 years old in
February, and Rachel is 3 months old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you the widow of the late Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, did you write in Russian a story of your experiences
in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I have. I think that you are familiar with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You furnished it to the Commission, did you not, or a copy
of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe for the Commission how you prepared this
document in Russian that you furnished to us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I wrote this document not specifically for this Commission,
but merely for myself. Perhaps there are, therefore, not enough facts for your
purpose in that document. This is the story of my life from the time I met him
in Minsk up to the very last days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And by "him" who did you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any assistance in preparing this document in
Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, no one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are all the statements in that document true insofar as you
know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Since your husband's death and even back to the time of the
assassination of President Kennedy, you have had a number of interviews with
people from the Secret Service and the FBI, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We have a record of more than 46 such interviews, and I assume
you cannot remember the exact number or all that was said in those interviews,
is that true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know how many there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As far as you can recall now, do you know of anything that is
not true in those interviews that you would like to correct or add to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I would like to correct some things because not everything
was true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell <span class="locked">us&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is not just that it wasn't true, but not quite exact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall some of the information that you gave in those
interviews that was incorrect that you would like to correct now? Will you
tell us that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the present time, I can't remember any specific instance, but
perhaps in the course of your questioning if it comes up I will say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the date that you arrived in the United States
with your husband, Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the 13th of June, 1962&mdash;I am not quite certain as to the
year&mdash;'61 or '62, I think '62.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you come to this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From Moscow via Poland, Germany, and Holland we came to
Amsterdam by train. And from Amsterdam to New York by ship, and New York
to Dallas by air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the name of the ship on which you came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was the SS <i>Rotterdam</i> but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What time of the day did you arrive in New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was&mdash;about noon or 1 p.m., thereabouts. It is hard to remember
the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did you stay in New York at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We stayed that evening and the next 24 hours in a hotel in
New York, and then we left the following day by air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the name of the hotel where you stayed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know the name of the hotel but it is in the Times
Square area, not far from the publishing offices of the New York Times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do during your stay in New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That evening we just walked around the city to take a look
at it. In the morning I remained in the hotel while Lee left in order to arrange
for tickets, and so forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you visit anyone or have visitors at your hotel during
that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We didn't have any visitors but I remember that with Lee
we visited some kind of an office, on official business, perhaps it had something
to do with immigration or with the tickets. Lee spoke to them in English and
I didn't understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would that be a Travelers' Aid Bureau or Red Cross?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not you or your husband received any
financial assistance for the trip to Texas at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know exactly where Lee got the money, but he said
that his brother Robert had given him the money. But the money for the trip
from the Soviet Union to New York was given to us by the American Embassy
in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what time of the day you left on the flight to
Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that by about 5 p.m. we were already in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you go to Dallas or Fort Worth at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Dallas we were met by the brother, Robert, he lived in Fort
Worth, and he took us from Dallas to Fort Worth and we stopped at the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who else stayed at Robert's house at that time besides your
family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. His family and no one else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did his family consist of at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He and his wife and two children, a boy and a girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did you stay at Robert's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About 1 to 1½ months&mdash;perhaps longer, but no longer than
2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were your relations and your husband's with Robert pleasant at
that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they were very good. His brother's relationship to us
was very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you briefly describe what you did during that time when
you were at Robert's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first time we got there we were, of course, resting for
about a week, and I was busy, of course, with my little girl who was then
very little. And in my free time, of course, I helped in the household.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband do anything around the house or did he seek
work right away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For about a week he was merely talking and took a trip
to the library. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then did he seek work in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did he find his first job there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. While we were with Robert. It seems it was at the end of
the second month that Lee found work. But at this time I don't remember
the date exactly but his mother who lived in Fort Worth at that time rented
a room and she proposed that we spend some time with her, that we live
with her for some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss with your husband this proposal of your
mother-in-law to have you live with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, she made the proposal to my husband, not to me.
Of course, I found out about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you and he have any discussion about it after you found
out about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You recall that discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I only remember the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he find work after you left Robert's then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You did move to be with your mother-in-law, lived with her
for a time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, about 3 weeks. And then after 3 weeks Lee did not
want to live with her any more and he rented an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the reason why he did not want to live there
any more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seemed peculiar to me and didn't want to believe it but
he did not love his mother, she was not quite a normal woman. Now, I know
this for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you that at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He talked about it but since he spoke in English to his
mother, I didn't understand it. There were quite a few scenes when he
would return from work he didn't want to talk to her. Perhaps she thought
I was the reason for the fact that Lee did not want to talk to her. And, of
course, for a mother this is painful and I told him that he should be
more attentive to his mother but he did not change. I think that one
of the reasons for this was that she talked a great deal about how much she
had done to enable Lee to return from Russia, and Lee felt that he had done
most of&mdash;the greatest effort in that respect and didn't want to discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did he find work at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course, if I had been told now I would have remembered
it because I have learned some English but at that time I didn't know, but
Lee told me that it wasn't far from Mercedes Street where we lived, and it was
really common labor connected with some kind of metal work, something for
buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say whether he enjoyed that work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall how long he stayed at that job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know but it seemed to me that he worked there for
about 3 or 4 months. Perhaps longer. Dates are one of my problems.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he left that job voluntarily or was
discharged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me that he had been discharged but I don't know why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you left the mother-in-law's house where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have already said that we moved to Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have an apartment there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, we rented an apartment in a duplex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the address on Mercedes Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't remember the exact number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe the apartment, how many rooms it had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Living room, kitchen, bath, and one bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This was the first time since you had come to this country then
that you had an opportunity to have a home of your own, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, we had our own home in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband work a full day at that time on this job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sometimes he even worked on Saturdays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do when he came home, did he help you with
housework?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He frequently went to a library. He read a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any of the books that he read at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I only know that they were books more of a historical
nature rather than fiction or literature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In your story in Russian you relate the fact that he read a
great deal of the time. Could you describe to the Commission just how that
was? Did he go off by himself to read or how did he handle that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He would bring a book from a library, sit in the living room
and read. I was busy with housework, and that is the way it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have differences between you about the time that he
spent reading rather than devoting it to you or the other members of the family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. We did have quarrels about his relationship to his mother,
the fact that he didn't want to change his relationship to his mother. I know
that he read so much that when we lived in New Orleans he used to read
sometimes all night long and in order not to disturb me he would be sitting
in the bathroom for several hours reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your quarrels start at that time when you were at Mercedes
Street the first time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, we didn't have many quarrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you were at Mercedes Street did you have Robert visit
you or did you visit him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he came to us sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall seeing any guns at Mercedes Street while you
were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your mother-in-law come to see you at Mercedes Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe the relationship between your husband and
your mother-in-law while he was at Mercedes Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She did not want us to move away to Mercedes Street, and
Lee did not want to remain with her and did not even want her to visit us
after that. Lee did not want her to know the address to which we were
moving and Robert helped us in the move. I felt very sorry for her. Sometime
after that she visited us while Lee was at work and I was quite surprised
wondering about how she found out our address. And then we had a quarrel
because he said to me, "Why did you open the door for her, I don't want her
to come here any more."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During this period did your husband spend much time with
the baby, June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He loved children very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you obtain a television set at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee wanted to buy a television set on credit. He then returned
it. Should I speak a little louder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Robert help any with the money or just in guaranteeing
the payments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that he only guaranteed the payments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall how much the television set cost?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So far as you know it was paid for out of your husband's
income?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you still at Mercedes Street when he lost his job with
the welding company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he try to find another job in Fort Worth then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know how much he looked for jobs before he found
one then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He looked for work for some time but he could not find it and
then some Russian friends of ours helped him find some work in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long was he out of work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me it was about 2 weeks; hard to remember,
perhaps that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did he find work in Dallas, do you remember the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know it was some kind of a printing company which prepares
photographs for newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he working with the photographic department of that
company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he an apprentice in that work trying to learn it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, at first he was an apprentice and later he worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what his income was when he was working for
the welding company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was about $200 a month, I don't know. I know it
was a dollar and a quarter an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he work much overtime at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not too much but sometimes he did work Saturdays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> Do you recall how much he received as pay at the printing
company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A dollar forty an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How many hours did he work a week, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He usually worked until 5 p.m. But sometimes he worked
later, and on Saturdays, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The ordinary work week at that time was the 5-day week then,
and the Saturdays would be an overtime period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who were the Russian friends who helped your husband find
this job in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did this friend and other Russian friends visit you at Mercedes
Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. When we lived at Fort Worth we became acquainted
with Peter Gregory, he is a Russian, he lives in Fort Worth and through him
we became acquainted with others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us insofar as you recall, the friends that you knew
in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Our first acquaintance was Gregory. Through him I met
Gali Clark, Mrs. Elena Hall. That is all in Fort Worth. And then we
met George Bouhe in Dallas, and Anna Meller, and Anna Ray and Katya Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By your answer do you mean that some of those people you
met in Dallas and some in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. George De Mohrenschildt&mdash;this was both in Fort Worth and
Dallas, the names of my recital but they were well acquainted with each other,
even though some lived in Dallas and some lived in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you please sort them out for us and tell us those you met
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You mean by the question, who out of these Russians lives in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Or which ones you met in Dallas as distinguished from those
you had already met in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Fort Worth I met the people from Dallas. There was
George Bouhe, George De Mohrenschildt&mdash;no. Anna Meller and George Bouhe
only, they were from Dallas, but I met them in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did these friends visit you at your home in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sometimes they came to visit us when they were in Dallas,
they came to us. Sometimes they made a special trip to come and see us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever visit them in their homes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, when we lived in Fort Worth we went to Dallas several
times to visit them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you made these visits did you go to spend an evening
or a considerable part of the time or were they short visits? Can you
describe that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We used to come early in the morning and leave at night.
We would spend the entire day with them. We went there by bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have an automobile of your own at any time during
this period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did any of these people have meals in your home when they
visited you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. They usually brought&mdash;they usually came for short visits
and they brought their own favorite vegetables such as cucumbers, George
liked cucumbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you moved to Dallas, where did you live the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not move to Dallas together with Lee. Lee went to
Dallas when he found the job, and I remained in Fort Worth and lived with
Elena Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. For how long a period did you live with Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that it was about a month and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During that month and a half what did your husband do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> He had a job. He was working. He would call me up over the
telephone but how he spent his time, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know during that month and a half where he lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At first, I know that he rented a room in the YMCA but very
shortly thereafter he rented an apartment. But where I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During that month and a half did he come and see you and the
baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, two or three times he came to see us because he had no
car. It was not very easy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were these trips to see you on the weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he came did he also stay at the Hall's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you were staying at the Hall's did you pay them for your
room and your meals?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. No, she was very friendly toward us and she tried to help us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you and your husband do when he came to see you?
Did he spend his time with you there in the home or did you go some place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, we didn't go anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he do any reading there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I remember that it was only a couple of times that he
came for a weekend. Generally, he only came for a very short period of time,
because he would come together with our friends, and they could not stay very
long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he came during that period did he discuss what he had
been doing in Dallas, his work and other things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He liked his work very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After this month and a half did he find a place for you all to
live together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, but it wasn't a problem there to find a place, no problem
there to find a place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you then move to a home in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, on Elsbeth, Elsbeth Street in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember the number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you move your things from Mrs. Hall's to the place on
Elsbeth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A friend who had a car helped us&mdash;I don't remember his name,
Taylor, Gary Taylor.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Suppose we take a recess now for about 10 minutes to allow
Mrs. Oswald to refresh herself.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> The Commission may be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did that require one or more trips to move your things from
Fort Worth to Dallas when you went to Elsbeth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One trip was enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you observe any guns in your things when you moved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What kind of place did you have at Elsbeth Street, was it rooms
or an apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. An apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How many rooms in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One living room, a bedroom, a kitchen, and the bathroom. It
sounds very small for all of you but for us it was quite sufficient.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a telephone there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what rent you paid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me that it was $60, plus the utilities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That would be $60 a month?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, and electricity and gas but the water was free. Sixty dollars
a month including water.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband help you with the housework at that address?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Yes, he always helped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about his reading habits there, were they the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, about the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us a little more fully about his reading? Did he
spend several hours each evening in this reading?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any of the books that he read at Elsbeth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He had two books, two thick books on the history of the
United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband come home for a midday meal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you go out in the evenings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sometimes we went shopping to stores, and movies, though
Lee really went to the movies himself. He wanted to take me but I did not
understand English. Then on weekends we would go to a lake not far away
or to a park or to a cafe for some ice cream.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you went to the lake or the park did you take food with
you and have a picnic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you get to the lake or the park, by bus or car, or what
means of transportation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was only 10 minutes away, 10 minutes walking time from us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were either you or your husband taking any schooling at that
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee took English courses or typing courses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During what days of the week were these typing courses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was three days a week. I don't remember exactly what the
days were. It seems to me it was 1 day at the beginning of the week and 2
days at the end of the week that he took these night courses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would it help you to recall if I suggested they were Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me that is the way it was. I know it was on
Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what hours of the evening he was supposed to be
at these classes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems that it was from 7 until 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what time would he get home from work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About 5 to 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then would you eat your evening meal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How soon after that would he leave for the class?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When Lee took his courses he generally did not come home
for dinner, usually he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he practice his typewriting at home at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At home, no. But he had a book, a textbook on typing which
he would review when he was at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How soon after the class was over did he come home ordinarily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nine o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you anything about friends that he met at these
classes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While you were at Elsbeth Street do you recall seeing any guns
in your apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember exhibiting any guns to the De Mohrenschildt's
while you were at Elsbeth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was on Neely Street, perhaps you are confused, this was
on Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you move to Neely Street from the Elsbeth Street
apartment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> In January after the new year. I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember why you moved from Elsbeth to Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I like it better on Neely Street. We had a porch there and that
was more convenient for the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What size apartment did you have on Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The same type of apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the only difference the terrace then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, except that it was on the second floor. It was a second-floor
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the Elsbeth Street apartment a first-floor apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about the rent? Was there a difference in rent between
the two places?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, it was the same rent. It is perhaps even less. It seems to
me it was $55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any differences with your husband while you were
at Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Well, there are always some reasons for some quarrel
between a husband and wife, not everything is always smooth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I had in mind if there was any violence or any hitting of you.
Did that occur at Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. That was on Elsbeth Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what brought that about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not quite. I am trying to remember. It seems to me that it
was at that time that Lee began to talk about his wanting to return to Russia.
I did not want that and that is why we had quarrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have discussions between you about this idea of returning
to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Lee wanted me to go to Russia. I told him that that&mdash;Lee
wanted me to go to Russia, and I told him that if he wanted me to go then
that meant that he didn't love me, and that in that case what was the idea of
coming to the United States in the first place. Lee would say that it would be
better for me if I went to Russia. I did not know why. I did not know what he
had in mind. He said he loved me but that it would be better for me if I went
to Russia, and what he had in mind I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know when he first started to talk about your going to
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Elsbeth Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember any occasion which you thought caused him
to start to talk that way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why he started to hit you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I think that I know, although at that time I didn't. I
think that he was very nervous and just this somehow relieved his tension.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you observe sometime when you thought he changed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that immediately after coming to the United States
Lee changed. I did not know him as such a man in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe how you observed these changes and what
they were as you saw them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He helped me as before, but he became a little more of a recluse.
He did not like my Russian friends and he tried to forbid me to have anything
to do with them.</p>

<p>He was very irritable, sometimes for a trifle, for a trifling reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why he did not like your Russian friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know why he didn't like them. I didn't understand.
At least that which he said was completely unfounded. He simply said some
stupid or foolish things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us the stupid things that he said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, he thought that they were fools for having left Russia;
they were all traitors. I would tell him he was in the same position being an
American in America but there were really no reasons but just irritation. He
said that they all only like money, and everything is measured by money. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
seems to me that perhaps he was envious of them in the sense they were more
prosperous than he was. When I told him, when I would say that to him he
did not like to hear that.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shouldn't say these foolish things and I feel kind of uncomfortable
to talk about the foolish things that happened or what he said foolish things.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why I don't know really the reasons for these quarrels
because sometimes the quarrels were just trifles. It is just that Lee was
very unrestrained and very explosive at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, we will ask you to be very frank with us. It isn't
for the purpose of embarrassing you or your husband that we ask you these
things but it might help us to understand and even if you will tell us the foolish
and stupid things it may shed some light on the problem. You understand that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand you are not asking these questions out of curiosity
but for a reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband indicate any particular Russian friends that
he disliked more than others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He liked De Mohrenschildt but he&mdash;because he was a strong
person, but only De Mohrenschildt. He did not like Bouhe or Anna Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever tell him you liked these people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I told him all the time that I liked these people and that
is why he was angry at me and would tell me that I was just like they were. At
one time I left him and went to my friends because he put me into&mdash;put me on
the spot by saying, "Well, if you like your friends so much then go ahead and
live with them," and he left me no choice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was this, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Elsbeth Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long were you gone from him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ask you to return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I took June and I went to Anna Meller, took a cab and
went there. I spent several days with her. Lee didn't know where I was but
he called up and about 2 or 3 days after I came to and we met at De Mohrenschildt's
house and he asked me to return home. I, of course, did not want a
divorce but I told him it would be better to get a divorce rather than to continue
living and quarreling this way. After all this is only a burden on a man if two
people live together and fight. I simply wanted to show him, too, that I am not
a toy. That a woman is a little more complicated. That you cannot trifle
with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything at that time about how he should treat you
if you returned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I told him if he did not change his character, then it
would become impossible to continue living with him. Because if there should
be such quarrels continuously that would be crippling for the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then he said that it would be&mdash;it was very hard for him. That
he could not change. That I must accept him, such as he was. And he asked
me to come back home with him right on that day but he left feeling bad because
I did not go and remained with my friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say about accepting him as he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him I was not going to. Of course, such as he was for
me he was good, but I wanted simply for the sake of the family that he would
correct his character. It isn't that I didn't mean to say he was good for me,
I meant to say that I could stand him, but for the sake of the children I wanted
him to improve his behavior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then did he get in touch with you again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time there was very little room at Anna Meller's and it
was very uncomfortable and I left and went to Katya Ford whose husband at
that time happened to be out of town on business. I spent several days with
Katya Ford but then when her husband returned I did not want to remain with
her. And it was on a Sunday morning then when I moved over to Anna Ray.
Lee called me and said he wanted to see me, that he had come by bus and he
wanted to see me and he came that evening and he cried and said that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
wanted me to return home because if I did not return he did not want to continue
living. He said he didn't know how to love me in any other way and that
he will try to change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While you were at Mrs. Ford's did she go to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I think that you are confused&mdash;this was Elena Hall in
Fort Worth, she was ill and went to the hospital. It is not very interesting to
hear all that. Somewhat boring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the manner in which Lee brought up the idea of
your going to Russia alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Quite simply he said it was very hard for him here. That he
could not have a steady job. It would be better for me because I could work
in Russia. That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand when he suggested it that he proposed
that you go and he stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Now, I think I know why he had in mind to start his
foolish activity which could harm me but, of course, at that time he didn't tell
me the reason. It is only now that I understand it. At that time when I would
ask him he would get angry because he couldn't tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What would you say to him at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him at that time that I am agreeable to going if he could
not live with me. But he kept on repeating that he wanted to live with me
but that it would be better for me, but when I wanted to know the reason he
would not tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there something that you have learned since that caused you
to believe that this suggestion was related to trying to provide for you or to be
sure that you wouldn't be hurt by what he was going to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time I didn't know this. I only saw that he was in such
a state that he was struggling and perhaps did not understand himself. I
thought that I was the reason for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have a job then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you feel that you were getting along on what he was earning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you urging him to earn more so that he could provide
more for the family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. We had enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You were not complaining about the way you were living?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I think that my friends had thought, and it was also
written in the newspapers that we lived poorly because for Americans $200
appears to be very little. But I have never lived in any very luxurious way
and, therefore, for me this was quite sufficient. Some of the others would say,
"well here, you don't have a car or don't have this or that." But for me it was
sufficient. Sometimes Lee would tell me I was just like my friends, that I
wanted to have that which they had. That I preferred them to him because
they give me more, but that is not true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand when he suggested you return to Russia
that he was proposing to break up your marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him that I would go to Russia if he would give me a
divorce, but he did not want to give me a divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that if he were to give me a divorce that that would
break everything between us, which he didn't want. That he wanted to keep
me as his wife, but I told him that if he wants to remain in the United States
I want to be free in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During this period did he appear to be more excited and
nervous?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not particularly, but the later time he was more excited and
more nervous but it was quite a contrast between the way he was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By the later time that you just referred to what do you mean?
Can you give us some approximate date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When we went to Neely Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> I think this is a good time to take our luncheon recess now.
So, we will adjourn until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> All right. Let us proceed.</p>

<p>(The Chairman administered the oath to Alvin I. Mills, Stenotype Reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, do you have the last questions?</p>

<p>In the future, would you do that, so we can refresh the witness about the
last couple of questions on her testimony? I think it will make it easier for
her, if she doesn't have to try to remember all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, as I recall you were telling us about these developments
at Neely Street when you found that your husband was suggesting
that you go back to Russia alone and you discussed that matter, and you
thought it had something to do with the idea he had, which I understood you
have discovered as you looked back or thought back later but didn't know at
the time fully. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you tell us those things that you observed that caused
you to think he had something in mind at that time, and I will ask you later,
after you tell us, those that you discovered since or that you have obtained more
light on since.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time I did not think anything about it. I had no reasons
to think that he had something in mind. I did not understand him at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the first time that you observed the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was on Neely Street. I think that was in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you learn about it? Did you see it some place in the
apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Lee had a small room where he spent a great deal of
time, where he read&mdash;where he kept his things, and that is where the rifle was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it out in the room at that time, as distinguished from in a
closet in the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was open, out in the open. At first I think&mdash;I saw some
package up on the top shelf, and I think that that was the rifle. But I didn't
know. And apparently later he assembled it and had it in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you saw the rifle assembled in the room, did it have the
scope on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, it did not have a scope on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any discussion with your husband about the rifle
when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course I asked him, "What do you need a rifle for? What
do we need that for?"</p>

<p>He said that it would come in handy some time for hunting. And this was
not too surprising because in Russia, too, we had a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In Russia did you have a rifle or a shotgun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know the difference. One and the other shoots. You
men. That is your business.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> My wife wouldn't know the difference, so it is all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never served in the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss what the rifle cost with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the rifle later placed in a closet in the apartment at Neely
Street?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> No, it was always either in a corner, standing up in a corner or
on a shelf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what happened to the gun that you had in Russia?
Was it brought over to this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he sold it there. I did not say so when I had the first
interviews. You must understand this was my husband. I didn't want to say
too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is this rifle at Neely Street the only rifle that you know of
that your husband had after you were married to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever show that rifle to the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know that De Mohrenschildts had said that the rifle had
been shown to him, but I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall your husband taking the rifle away from the
apartment on Neely Street at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You must know that the rifle&mdash;it isn't as if it was out in the
open. He would hang a coat or something to mask its presence in the room.
And sometimes when he walked out, when he went out in the evening I didn't
know, because I didn't go into that room very often. I don't know whether he
took it with him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see him clean the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I said before I had never seen it before. But I think
you understand. I want to help you, and that is why there is no reason for
concealing anything. I will not be charged with anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gopadze</span>. She says she was not sworn in before. But now inasmuch as
she is sworn in, she is going to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you see him clean the rifle a number of times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you help us by giving some estimate of the times as you
remember it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About four times&mdash;about four or five times, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband ever tell you why he was cleaning the&mdash;that
is, that he had been using it and needed to be cleaned after use?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I did not ask him, because I thought it was quite normal
that when you have a rifle you must clean it from time to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever observe your husband taking the rifle away from
the apartment on Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I think that he probably did sometimes, but I never did
see it. You must understand that sometimes I would be in the kitchen and he
would be in his room downstairs, and he would say bye-bye, I will be back soon,
and he may have taken it. He probably did. Perhaps he purely waited for an
occasion when he could take it away without my seeing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever observe that the rifle had been taken out of the
apartment at Neely Street&mdash;that is, that it was gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Before the incident with General Walker, I know that Lee was
preparing for something. He took photographs of that house and he told me
not to enter his room. I didn't know about these photographs, but when I came
into the room once in general he tried to make it so that I would spend less
time in that room. I noticed that quite accidentally one time when I was
cleaning the room he tried to take care of it himself.</p>

<p>I asked him what kind of photographs are these, but he didn't say anything
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the photographs of the Walker house that you were
asking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Later, after he had fired, he told me about it.</p>

<p>I didn't know that he intended to do it&mdash;that he was planning to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn at any time that he had been practicing with the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that he went once or twice. I didn't actually see him
take the rifle, but I knew that he was practicing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you give us a little help on how you knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me. And he would mention that in passing&mdash;it isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
as if he said, "Well, today I am going"&mdash;it wasn't as if he said, "Well, today I
am going to take the rifle and go and practice."</p>

<p>But he would say, "Well, today I will take the rifle along for practice."</p>

<p>Therefore, I don't know whether he took it from the house or whether perhaps
he even kept the rifle somewhere outside. There was a little square, sort of a
little courtyard where he might have kept it.</p>

<p>When you asked me about the rifle, I said that Lee didn't have a rifle, but
he also had a gun, a revolver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall when he first had the pistol, that you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had that on Neely Street, but I think that he acquired the
rifle before he acquired the pistol. The pistol I saw twice&mdash;once in his room,
and the second time when I took these photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What period of time was there between when he got the rifle
and you learned of it, and the time that you first learned about the pistol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you testified about his practicing with the rifle, are you
describing a period when you were still at Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know where he practiced with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know where. I don't know the name of the place where
this took place. But I think it was somewhere out of town. It seems to me a
place called Lopfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would that be at the airport&mdash;Love Field?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So you think he was practicing out in the open and not at a
rifle range?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall seeing the rifle when the telescopic lens was on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I hadn't paid any attention initially.</p>

<p>I know a rifle was a rifle. I didn't know whether or not it had a telescope attached
to it. But the first time I remember seeing it was in New Orleans, where
I recognized the telescope. But probably the telescope was on before. I simply
hadn't paid attention.</p>

<p>I hope you understand. When I saw it, I thought that all rifles have that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you make any objection to having the rifle around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That for a man to have a rifle&mdash;since I am a woman, I don't
understand him, and I shouldn't bother him. A fine life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that the same rifle that you are referring to that you took the
picture of with your husband and when he had the pistol, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I asked him then why he had dressed himself up like
that, with the rifle and the pistol, and I thought that he had gone crazy, and
he said he wanted to send that to a newspaper. This was not my business&mdash;it
was man's business.</p>

<p>If I had known these were such dangerous toys, of course&mdash;you understand that
I thought that Lee had changed in that direction, and I didn't think it was a
serious occupation with him, just playing around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the day that you took the picture of him with the
rifle and the pistol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that that was towards the end of February, possibly the
beginning of March. I can't say exactly. Because I didn't attach any significance
to it at the time. That was the only time I took any pictures.</p>

<p>I don't know how to take pictures. He gave me a camera and asked me&mdash;if
someone should ask me how to photograph, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it on a day off that you took the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did it occur? Did he come to you and ask you to take the
picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was hanging up diapers, and he came up to me with the
rifle and I was even a little scared, and he gave me the camera and asked me to
press a certain button.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> And he was dressed up with a pistol at the same time, was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have examined that picture since, and noticed that the
telescopic lens was on at the time the picture was taken, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now I paid attention to it. A specialist would see it immediately,
of course. But at that time I did not pay any attention at all. I saw just
Lee. These details are of great significance for everybody, but for me at that
time it didn't mean anything. At the time that I was questioned, I had even
forgotten that I had taken two photographs. I thought there was only one.
I thought that there were two identical pictures, but they turned out to be two
different poses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the prints of the photograph
after the prints were made? That is, did you put them in a photographic album
yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee gave me one photograph and asked me to keep it for June
somewhere. Of course June doesn't need photographs like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall how long after that the Walker matter occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two, perhaps three weeks later. I don't know. You know
better when this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you first learn that your husband had shot at General
Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That evening he went out, I thought that he had gone to his
classes or perhaps that he just walked out or went out on his own business. It
got to be about 10 or 10:30, he wasn't home yet, and I began to be worried. Perhaps
even later.</p>

<p>Then I went into his room. Somehow, I was drawn into it&mdash;you know&mdash;I
was pacing around. Then I saw a note there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you look for the gun at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I didn't understand anything. On the note it said, "If
I am arrested" and there are certain other questions, such as, for example, the
key to the mailbox is in such and such a place, and that he left me some money
to last me for some time, and I couldn't understand at all what can he be
arrested for. When he came back I asked him what had happened. He was
very pale. I don't remember the exact time, but it was very late.</p>

<p>And he told me not to ask him any questions. He only told me that he had
shot at General Walker.</p>

<p>Of course I didn't sleep all night. I thought that any minute now, the police
will come. Of course I wanted to ask him a great deal. But in his state I
decided I had best leave him alone&mdash;it would be purposeless to question him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say any more than that about the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course in the morning I told him that I was worried, and
that we can have a lot of trouble, and I asked him, "Where is the rifle? What
did you do with it?"</p>

<p>He said, that he had left it somewhere, that he had buried it, it seems to me,
somewhere far from that place, because he said dogs could find it by smell.</p>

<p>I don't know&mdash;I am not a criminologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why he had shot at General Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him that he had no right to kill people in peacetime, he
had no right to take their life because not everybody has the same ideas as he
has. People cannot be all alike.</p>

<p>He said that this was a very bad man, that he was a fascist, that he was
the leader of a fascist organization, and when I said that even though all of that
might be true, just the same he had no right to take his life, he said if someone
had killed Hitler in time it would have saved many lives. I told him that this
is no method to prove your ideas, by means of a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him how long he had been planning to do this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He said he had been planning for two months. Yes&mdash;perhaps
he had planned to do so even earlier, but according to his conduct I
could tell he was planning&mdash;he had been planning this for two months or perhaps
a little even earlier.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Would you like to take a little recess?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, thank you. Better to get it over with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> Did he show you a picture of the Walker house then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He had a book&mdash;he had a notebook in which he noted
down quite a few details. It was all in English, I didn't read it. But I noticed
the photograph. Sometimes he would lock himself in his room and write in
the book. I thought that he was writing some other kind of memoirs, as he had
written about his life in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever read that book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know of anything else he had in it besides this Walker
house picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Photographs and notes, and I think there was a map
in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. There was a map of the area where the Walker house was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was a map of Dallas, but I don't know where Walker
lived. Sometimes evenings he would be busy with this. Perhaps he was calculating
something, but I don't know. He had a bus schedule and computed
something.</p>

<p>After this had happened, people thought that he had a car, but he had been
using a bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he explain to you about his being able to use a bus just
as well as other people could use a car&mdash;something of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Simply as a passenger. He told me that even before
that time he had gone also to shoot, but he had returned. I don't know why.
Because on the day that he did fire, there was a church across the street and
there were many people there, and it was easier to merge in the crowd and not
be noticed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him about this note that he had left, what he
meant by it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;he said he had in mind that if in case he were arrested,
I would know what to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The note doesn't say anything about Walker, does it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him if that is what he meant by the note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, because as soon as he came home I showed him the note
and asked him "What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And that is when he gave you the explanation about the
Walker shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I know that on a Sunday he took the rifle, but I don't think he fired on a
Sunday. Perhaps this was on Friday. So Sunday he left and took the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If the Walker shooting was on Wednesday, does that refresh
your memory as to the day of the week at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Refresh my memory as to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As to the day of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was in the middle of the week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he give any further explanation of what had happened that
evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he fired, he did not know whether he had hit Walker or
not. He didn't take the bus from there. He ran several kilometers and then
took the bus. And he turned on the radio and listened, but there were no
reports.</p>

<p>The next day he bought a paper and there he read it was only chance that
saved Walker's life. If he had not moved, he might have been killed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he comment on that at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said only that he had taken very good aim, that it was just
chance that caused him to miss. He was very sorry that he had not hit him.</p>

<p>I asked him to give me his word that he would not repeat anything like that.
I said that this chance shows that he must live and that he should not be shot
at again. I told him that I would save the note and that if something like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
should be repeated again, I would go to the police and I would have the proof
in the form of that note.</p>

<p>He said he would not repeat anything like that again.</p>

<p>By the way, several days after that, the De Mohrenschildts came to us, and as
soon as he opened the door he said, "Lee, how is it possible that you missed?"</p>

<p>I looked at Lee. I thought that he had told De Mohrenschildt about it. And
Lee looked at me, and he apparently thought that I had told De Mohrenschildt
about it. It was kind of dark. But I noticed&mdash;it was in the evening, but I
noticed that his face changed, that he almost became speechless.</p>

<p>You see, other people knew my husband better than I did. Not always&mdash;but
in this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was De Mohrenschildt a friend that he told&mdash;your husband
told him personal things that you knew of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He asked Lee not because Lee had told him about it, but I
think because he is smart enough man to have been able to guess it. I don't
know&mdash;he is simply a liberal, simply a man. I don't think that he is being
accused justly of being a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is De Mohrenschildt that you refer to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell the authorities anything about this Walker
incident when you learned about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have told the Secret Service or the FBI people reasons why
you didn't. Will you tell us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Why I did not tell about it?</p>

<p>First, because it was my husband. As far as I know, according to the local
laws here, a wife cannot be a witness against her husband. But, of course, if
I had known that Lee intended to repeat something like that, I would have
told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ask you to return the note to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He forgot about it. But apparently after that he thought
that what he had written in his book might be proof against him, and he
destroyed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is this book that you have just referred to in which he
had the Walker house picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was a notebook, yes, that is the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do with the note that he had left for you after
you talked about it and said you were going to keep it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had it among my things in a cookbook. But I have two&mdash;I
don't remember in which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your relations with your husband change after this Walker
incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe to us the changes as you observed them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Soon after that, Lee lost his job&mdash;I don't know for what reason.
He was upset by it. And he looked for work for several days. And then I
insisted that it would be better for him to go to New Orleans where he had
relatives. I insisted on that because I wanted to get him further removed
from Dallas and from Walker, because even though he gave me his word, I
wanted to have him further away, because a rifle for him was not a very good
toy&mdash;a toy that was too enticing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say that you wanted him to go to New Orleans because
of the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I simply told him that I wanted to see his home town. He
had been born there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he promised you that he would not do anything like that
again, did you then believe him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not quite believe him inasmuch as the rifle remained in
the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him to get rid of the rifle at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> After he shot at Walker, did you notice his taking the rifle
out any more to practice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall when you went to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was in May. Lee went there himself, by himself.
At that time, I became acquainted with Mrs. Paine, and I stayed with her while
he was looking for work. In about one week Lee telephoned me that he had
found a job and that I should come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first get acquainted with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was a couple of months earlier&mdash;probably in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you happen to go to Mrs. Paine's house to stay? Did she
invite you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes; she invited me. I had become acquainted with her through
some Russian friends of ours. We had visited with some people, and she was
there. Inasmuch as she was studying Russian, she invited me to stay with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you pay her anything for staying with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I only repaid her in the sense that I helped her in the
household and that I gave her Russian language lessons. This, in her words, was
the very best pay that I could give her. And she wanted that I remain with
her longer.</p>

<p>But, of course, it was better for me to be with my husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did your husband let you know that he had found a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He telephoned me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you then leave at once for New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And how did you get to New Orleans from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Paine took me there in her car. She took her children
and my things and we went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have much in the way of household goods to move?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Everything&mdash;we could put everything into one car. But, in fact,
most of the things Lee had taken with him. Because he went by bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he take the gun with him to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember exactly, but it seems to me that it was not
among my things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you live at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Magazine Street. By the time I arrived there Lee already had
rented an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When Mrs. Paine brought you down to New Orleans, did she
stay with you for any period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, she was there for two days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did Mrs. Paine and your husband get along? Were they
friendly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She was very good to us, to Lee and to me, and Lee was quite
friendly with her, but he did not like her. I know that he didn't like her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why he didn't like her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He considered her to be a stupid woman. Excuse me&mdash;these
are not my words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you and Mrs. Paine good friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, so-so. I tried to help her as much as I could. But I also&mdash;I
was&mdash;I did not like her too well. I also considered her not to be a very smart
woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I think it is about time for a recess, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Very well. We will take a recess for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> The Committee will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, you may continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, did you discuss the Walker shooting with Mrs.
Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I didn't tell anyone. Apart from the FBI. That is after&mdash;that
is later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was it that you told the FBI about the Walker shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About 2 weeks after Lee was killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> Before you went to New Orleans, had you seen anyone from the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The FBI visited us in Fort Worth when we lived on Mercedes
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that in August 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the names of the FBI agents that visited you then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't remember that Lee had just returned from work
and we were getting ready to have dinner when a car drove up and man introduced
himself and asked Lee to step out and talk to him.</p>

<p>There was another man in the car. They talked for about 2 hours and I was
very angry, because everything had gotten cold. This meant more work for me.
I asked who these were, and he was very upset over the fact that the FBI was
interested in him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did that interview take place in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband tell you what they said to him and what he
said to them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know to what extent this was true, but Lee said that the
FBI had told him that in the event some Russians might visit him and would
try to recruit him to work for them, he should notify the FBI agents. I don't
know to what extent this was true. But perhaps Lee just said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did our husband say anything about the FBI asking him to
work for them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he didn't tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything more about what they said to him in this
interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he didn't tell me verbatim, but he said that they saw
Communists in everybody and they are very much afraid and inasmuch as I
had returned from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you that they had asked him whether he had acted
as an agent or was asked to be an agent for the Russians?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any <span class="locked">other&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. They did ask him about whether the Russians had
proposed that he be an agent for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you what he said to them in that regard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me that he had answered no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After this interview by the FBI agents, do you recall any later
interview with them and yourself or your husband before you went to New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, there were no other interviews.</p>

<p>The next time was in Irving, when I lived with Mrs. Paine. But that is after
I returned from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At New Orleans, who did your husband work for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He worked for the Louisiana Coffee Co. But I don't know
in what capacity. I don't think that this was very good job, or perhaps more
correctly, he did not&mdash;I know that he didn't like this job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what he received in pay from that job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. $1.35 an hour, I think. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did he work for this coffee company?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was from May until August, to the end of August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he discharged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then was he unemployed for a time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you had discussed with your husband your going to Russia,
was anything done about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I wrote a letter to the Soviet Embassy with a request to be
permitted to return. And then it seems to me after I was already in New
Orleans, I wrote another letter in which I told the Embassy that my husband
wants to return with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the date of the first letter that you just referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. But that is easily determined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you asking for a visa to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss with your husband his returning with you before
you wrote the second letter that you have described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't ask him. He asked me to do so one day when he was
extremely upset. He appeared to be very unhappy and he said that nothing
keeps him here, and that he would not lose anything if he returned to the Soviet
Union, and that he wants to be with me. And that it would be better to have less
but not to be concerned about tomorrow, not to be worried about tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this a change in his attitude?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Towards me or towards Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Towards going to Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't think that he was too fond of Russia, but simply that
he knew that he would have work assured him there, because he had&mdash;after all,
he had to think about his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know that he did get a passport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me he always had a passport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While he was in New Orleans, that he got a passport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, it seems to me that after we came here, he immediately
received a passport. I don't know. I always saw his green passport. He even
had two&mdash;one that had expired, and a new one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know when the new one was issued?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. It seems to me in the Embassy when we arrived. I don't
know.</p>

<p>But please understand me correctly, I am not hiding this. I simply don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know about a letter from your husband to the Embassy
asking that his request for a visa be considered separately from yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you were at New Orleans, did your husband go to school,
that you knew of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he spend his earnings with you and your child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Most of the time, yes. But I know that he became active with
some kind of activity in a pro-Cuban committee. I hope that is what you are
looking for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first notice the rifle at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As soon as I arrived in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was it kept there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He again had a closet-like room with his things in it. He
had his clothes hanging there, all his other belongings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the rifle in a cover there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you notice him take it away from your home there in New
Orleans at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I know for sure that he didn't. But I know that we had
a kind of a porch with a&mdash;screened-in porch, and I know that sometimes evenings
after dark he would sit there with his rifle. I don't know what he did with it.
I came there by chance once and saw him just sitting there with his rifle.
I thought he is merely sitting there and resting. Of course I didn't like these
kind of little jokes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us an idea of how often this happened that you
recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It began to happen quite frequently after he was arrested there
in connection with some demonstration and handing out of leaflets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that the Fair Play for Cuba demonstration?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. From what you observed about his having the rifle on the back
porch, in the dark, could you tell whether or not he was trying to practice with
the telescopic lens?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I asked him why. But this time he was preparing to go
to Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was his explanation for practicing with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He said that he would go to Cuba. I told him I was not
going with him&mdash;that I would stay here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On these occasions when he was practicing with the rifle, would
they be three or four times a week in the evening, after the Fair Play for Cuba
incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Almost every evening. He very much wanted to go to Cuba and
have the newspapers write that somebody had kidnapped an aircraft. And I
asked him "For God sakes, don't do such a thing."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he describe that idea to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when he told you of it, did he indicate that he wanted to
be the one that would kidnap the airplane himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he wanted to do that. And he asked me that I should
help him with that. But I told him I would not touch that rifle.</p>

<p>This sounds very merry, but I am very much ashamed of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell him that using the rifle in this way, talking about
it, was not in accordance with his agreement with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that everything would go well. He was very self-reliant&mdash;if
I didn't want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any talk of divorce during this period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. During this time, we got along pretty well not counting
the incidents with Cuba. I say relatively well, because we did not really have&mdash;generally
he helped me quite a bit and was good to me. But, of course, I did
not agree with his views.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At this time in New Orleans did he discuss with you his views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mostly&mdash;most of the conversations were on the subject of Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anything said about the United States&mdash;not liking
the United States.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I can't say&mdash;he liked some things in Russia, he liked
some other things here, didn't like some things there, and didn't like some things
here.</p>

<p>And I am convinced that as much as he knew about Cuba, all he knew was
from books and so on. He wanted to convince himself. But I am sure that if
he had gone there, he would not have liked it there, either. Only on the moon,
perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you what he didn't like about the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First of all, he didn't like the fact that there are fascist organizations
here. That was one thing.</p>

<p>The second thing, that it was hard to get an education and hard to find work.
And that medical expenses were very high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say who he blamed for this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't blame anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say anything about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. At least&mdash;I was always interested in President Kennedy
and had asked him many times to translate articles in a newspaper or magazine
for me, and he always had something good to say. He translated it, but never
did comment on it. At least in Lee's behavior&mdash;from Lee's behavior I cannot
conclude that he was against the President, and therefore the thing is incomprehensible
to me. Perhaps he hid it from me. I don't know. He said that
after 20 years he would be prime minister. I think that he had a sick imagination&mdash;at
least at that time I already considered him to be not quite normal&mdash;not
always, but at times. I always tried to point out to him that he was a man
like any others who were around us. But he simply could not understand that.</p>

<p>I tried to tell him that it would be better to direct his energies to some more
practical matters, and not something like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what you observed about him that caused you
to think he was different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At least his imagination, his fantasy, which was quite unfounded,
as to the fact that he was an outstanding man. And then the fact
that he was very much interested, exceedingly so, in autobiographical works of
outstanding statesmen of the United States and others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anything else of that kind that caused you to think
that he was different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that he compared himself to these people whose autobiographies
he read. That seems strange to me, because it is necessary to have
an education in order to achieve success of that kind. After he became busy
with his pro-Cuban activity, he received a letter from somebody in New York,
some Communist&mdash;probably from New York&mdash;I am not sure from where&mdash;from
some Communist leader and he was very happy, he felt that this was a
great man that he had received the letter from.</p>

<p>You see, when I would make fun of him, of his activity to some extent, in
the sense that it didn't help anyone really, he said that I didn't understand
him, and here, you see, was proof that someone else did, that there were people
who understood his activity.</p>

<p>I would say that to Lee&mdash;that Lee could not really do much for Cuba, that
Cuba would get along well without him, if they had to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You would tell that to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what would he say in return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He shrugged his shoulders and kept his own opinion. He was
even interested in the airplane schedules, with the idea of kidnapping a plane.
But I talked him out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The airplane schedules from New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. New Orleans&mdash;but&mdash;from New Orleans&mdash;leaving New Orleans
in an opposite direction. And he was going to make it turn around and go to
Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He discussed this with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did his Fair Play for Cuba activity occur&mdash;before or after
he lost his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After he lost his job. I told him it would be much better if
he were working, because when he didn't work he was busy with such foolishness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing. And it is at that time that I wrote a letter to Mrs.
Paine telling her that Lee was out of work, and they invited me to come and
stay with her. And when I left her, I knew that Lee would go to Mexico City.
But, of course, I didn't tell Mrs. Paine about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had he discussed with you the idea of going to Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did he first discuss that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was in August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why he wanted to go to Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From Mexico City he wanted to go to Cuba&mdash;perhaps through
the Russian Embassy in Mexico somehow he would be able to get to Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about going to Russia by way of Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know that he said that in the embassy. But he only said so.
I know that he had no intention of going to Russia then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me. I know Lee fairly well&mdash;well enough from that
point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you that he was going to Cuba and send you on to
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he proposed that after he got to Cuba, that I would go
there, too, somehow.</p>

<p>But he also said that after he was in Cuba, and if he might go to Russia, he
would let me know in any case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he discuss Castro and the Cuban Government with you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did he start to do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the time that he was busy with that pro-Cuban activity.
He was sympathetic to Castro while in Russia, and I have also a good opinion
of Castro to the extent that I know. I don't know anything bad about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about Castro to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he is a very smart statesman, very useful for
his government, and very active.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said, "Maybe." It doesn't make any difference to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know he was writing to the Fair Play for Cuba organization
in New York during this latter period in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he show you that correspondence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me about it. Or, more correctly, I saw that he was
writing to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you write the Russian Embassy in regard to your visa
from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what address you gave in New Orleans when you
wrote?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't remember. Sometimes I would write a letter, but
Lee would insert the address and would mail the letters. That is why I don't
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you get your mail in New Orleans at your apartment or
at a post office box?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, we had a post office box, and that is where we received
our mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband have any organization in his Fair Play for
Cuba at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he had no organization. He was alone. He was quite alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you learn about his arrest there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The next day, when he was away from home overnight and
returned, he told me he had been arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was smiling, but in my opinion he was upset. I think that
after that occurrence&mdash;he became less active, he cooled off a little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Less active in the Fair Play for Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He continued it, but more for a person's sake. I think
that his heart was no longer in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you that the FBI had seen him at the jail in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he complain about his arrest and say it was unfair, anything
of that kind.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know he paid a fine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have anything to do with trying to get him out of
jail?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>He was only there for 24 hours. He paid his fine and left. He said that the
policeman who talked to him was very kind, and was a very good person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While you were in New Orleans, did you get to know the
Murrets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. They are his relatives. I think that Lee engaged in this
activity primarily for purposes of self-advertising. He wanted to be arrested.
I think he wanted to get into the newspapers, so that he would be known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you think he wanted to be advertised and known as being
in support of Cuba before he went to Cuba?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you think he thought that would help him when he got
to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you anything about that, or is that just what you
guess?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He would collect the newspaper clippings about his&mdash;when the
newspapers wrote about him, and he took these clippings with him when he
went to Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did the Murrets come to visit you from time to time in New
Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;sometimes they came to us, and sometimes we went to
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that a friendly relationship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that they were more of a family relationship type.
They were very good to us. His uncle, that is the husband of his aunt, was a
very good man. He tried to reason with Lee after that incident. Lee liked them
very much as relatives but he didn't like the fact that they were all very
religious.</p>

<p>When his uncle, or, again, the husband of his aunt would tell him that he
must approach things with a more serious attitude, and to worry about himself
and his family, Lee would say, "Well, these are just bourgeois, who are only
concerned with their own individual welfare."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. The word Mrs. Oswald used is not quite bourgeois, but it is a
person of a very narrow viewpoint who is only concerned with his own personal
interests, inclined to be an egotist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you hear the discussion when the uncle talked about this
Fair Play for Cuba and his activities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did the uncle say to your husband about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time. I did not know English too well, and Lee would
not interpret for me. He only nodded his head. But I knew that he did not
agree with his uncle. His uncle said that he condemned that kind of activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was your husband's attitude about your learning
English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He never talked English to me at home, and did not give me
any instruction. This was strictly my own business. But he did want me to
learn English. But that was my own concern. I had to do that myself
somehow. That is the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did any of your Russian friends visit you at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Outside of the Murrets, were there some people from New
Orleans that visited you at your home in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Once or twice a woman visited who was a friend of Ruth
Paine's. Ruth Paine has written her. She had written to Ruth Paine to find
out whether she knew any Russians there. And once or twice this woman
visited us. But other than that, no one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the name of this woman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember. I only remember that her first name is
also Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband have friends of his that visited you there
at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Once some time after Lee was arrested, on a Saturday or a Sunday morning,
a man came early and questioned Lee about the activity of the allegedly
existing organization, which really did not exist. Because in the newspaper
accounts Lee was described as a member and even the leader of that organization,
which in reality did not exist at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know who that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't. I asked Lee who that was, and he said that is
probably some anti-Cuban, or perhaps an FBI agent. He represented himself
as a man who was sympathetic to Cuba but Lee did not believe him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband ever tell you what he told the FBI agent
when they came to the jail to see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you wrote Mrs. Paine, did she come at once in response
to your letter to take you back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not quite at once. She came about a month later. She
apparently was on vacation at that time, and said that she would come
after her vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Didn't she indicate that she was going to come around September
30, and then came a little before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. In her letter to me she indicated that she would come
either the 20th or the 21st of September, and she did come at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you move your household goods in her station wagon at
that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not the rifle was carried in the
station wagon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have anything to do with loading it in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Lee was loading everything on because I was pregnant
at the time. But I know that Lee loaded the rifle on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the rifle carried in some kind of a case when you went
back with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After we arrived. I tried to put the bed, the child's crib
together, the metallic parts, and I looked for a certain part, and I came upon
something wrapped in a blanket. I thought that was part of the bed, but
it turned out to be the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember whether the pistol was carried back in
Mrs. Paine's car too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know where the pistol was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you went back to Mrs. Paine's house, did you discuss
whether you would be paying her anything for board and room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She proposed that I again live with her on the same conditions
as before. Because this was more advantageous for her than to pay
a school. She received better instruction that way.</p>

<p>In any case, she didn't spend any extra money for me&mdash;she didn't spend
any more than she usually spent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you give her lessons in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, these were not quite lessons. It was more in the nature
of conversational practice. And then I also helped her to prepare Russian
lessons for the purpose of teaching Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you found the rifle wrapped in the blanket, upon your
return to Mrs. Paine's, where was it located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the garage, where all the rest of the things were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In what part of the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In that part which is closer to the street, because that
garage is connected to the house. One door opens on the kitchen, and the
other out in the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the rifle lying down or was it standing up on the
butt end?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, it was lying down on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When your husband talked about going to Mexico City,
did he say where he was going to go there, who he would visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He said that he would go to the Soviet Embassy and
to the Cuban Embassy and would do everything he could in order to get
to Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you where he would stay in Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In a hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he didn't know where he would stop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any discussion about the expense of making the
trip?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. But we always lived very modestly, and Lee always had
some savings. Therefore, he had the money for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say how much it would cost?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had a little over $100 and he said that that would be
sufficient.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he talk about getting you a silver bracelet or any presents
before he went?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is perhaps more truth to say that he asked me what I
would like, and I told him that I would like Mexican silver bracelets. But
what he did buy me I didn't like at all. When he returned to Irving, from
Mexico City, and I saw the bracelet, I was fairly sure that he had bought it
in New Orleans and not in Mexico City, because I had seen bracelets like that
for sale there. That is why I am not sure that the bracelet was purchased in
Mexico.</p>

<p>Lee had an identical bracelet which he had bought in either Dallas or New
Orleans. It was a man's bracelet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The silver bracelet he gave you when he got back had your name
on it, did it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it too small?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I was offended because it was too small, and he promised
to exchange it. But, of course, I didn't want to hurt him, and I said, thank
you, the important thing is the thought, the attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he discuss other things that he planned to do in Mexico
City, such as see the bullfights or jai alai games or anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I was already questioned about this game by the FBI,
but I never heard of it. But I had asked Lee to buy some Mexican records,
but he did not do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know how he got to Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he return by bus, also?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems, yes. Yes, he told me that a round-trip ticket was
cheaper than two one-way tickets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn that he had a tourist card to go to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If he had such a card, you didn't know it then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After he had been to Mexico City, did he come back to Irving
or to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When Lee returned I was already in Irving and he telephoned
me. But he told me that he had arrived the night before and had spent the
night in Dallas, and called me in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say where he had been in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me at the YMCA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he come right out to see you then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you anything about his trip to Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he told me that he had visited the two embassies, that
he had received nothing, that the people who are there are too much&mdash;too
bureaucratic. He said that he has spent the time pretty well. And I had told
him that if he doesn't accomplish anything to at least take a good rest. I was
hoping that the climate, if nothing else, would be beneficial to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him what he did the rest of the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I think he said that he visited a bull fight, that he spent
most of his time in museums, and that he did some sightseeing in the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you about anyone that he met there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>He said that he did not like the Mexican girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you anything about what happened at the Cuban
Embassy, or consulate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Only that he had talked to certain people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you what people he talked to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> He said that he first visited the Soviet Embassy in the hope
that having been there first this would make it easier for him at the Cuban
Embassy. But there they refused to have anything to do with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what did he say about the visit to the Cuban Embassy or
consulate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was quite without results.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he complain about the consular or any of the officials of
the Cuban Embassy and the way they handled the matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he called them bureaucrats. He said that the Cubans
seemed to have a system similar to the Russians&mdash;too much red tape before you
get through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything else that he told you about the Mexico City
trip that you haven't related?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, that is all that I can remember about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall how long he was gone on his trip to Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All of this took approximately 2 weeks, from the time that I
left New Orleans, until the time that he returned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And from the time he left the United States to go to Mexico
City to his return, was that about 7 days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He said he was there for about a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you were asked before about the trip to Mexico, you did
not say that you knew anything about it. Do you want to explain to the
Commission how that happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Most of these questions were put to me by the FBI. I do
not like them too much. I didn't want to be too sincere with them. Though
I was quite sincere and answered most of their questions. They questioned me
a great deal, and I was very tired of them, and I thought that, well, whether
I knew about it or didn't know about it didn't change matters at all, it didn't
help anything, because the fact that Lee had been there was already known,
and whether or not I knew about it didn't make any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that the only reason that you did not tell about what you
knew of the Mexico City trip before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, because the first time that they asked me I said no, I didn't
know anything about it. And in all succeeding discussions I couldn't very well
have said I did. There is nothing special in that. It wasn't because this was
connected with some sort of secret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband stay with you at the Paines after that first
night when he returned from Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he stayed overnight there.</p>

<p>And in the morning we took him to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And by "we" who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ruth Paine, I and her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what he did in Dallas, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He intended to rent an apartment in the area of Oak Cliff,
and to look for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he did that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I know that he always tried to get some work. He was
not lazy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he rent the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the same day he rented a room, not an apartment, and he
telephoned me and told me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss the plans for this room before you took him to
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I asked him where he would live, and he said it would
be best if he rented a room, it would not be as expensive as an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about whether you would be living with
him, or he would be living there alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I did not really want to be with Lee at that time, because
I was expecting, and it would have been better to be with a woman who spoke
English and Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know where your husband looked for work in Dallas
at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> No. He tried to get any kind of work. He answered ads,
newspaper ads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have trouble finding work again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long after his return was it before he found a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two to three weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he was unemployed in New Orleans, did he get unemployment
compensation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know how much he was getting then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. $33 a week. It is possible to live on that money. One can
fail to find work and live. Perhaps you don't believe me. It is not bad to rest
and receive money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he was unemployed in Dallas, do you know whether he
received unemployment compensation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were due to receive unemployment compensation, but it
was getting close to the end of his entitlement period, and we received one more
check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss with him possible places of employment after
his return from Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. That was his business. I couldn't help him in that. But
to some extent I did help him find a job, because I was visiting Mrs. Paine's
neighbors. There was a woman there who told me where he might find some
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember. If that is important, I can try and ascertain
date. But I think you probably know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it shortly before he obtained work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As soon as we got the information, the next day he went there
and he did get the job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And who was it that you got the information from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was the neighbor whose brother was employed by the school
book depository. He said it seemed to him there was a vacancy there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, I think we have arrived at our adjournment time.
We will recess now until tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10 a.m. on February 4, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman
Cooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, John J.
McCloy, and Allen W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant
counsel; Leon I. Gopadze and William D. Krimer, interpreters; and John M.
Thorne, attorney for Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, will you proceed with the questioning of Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, there are a number of things about some of the
material we have been over, the period we have been over, that I would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
to ask you about, sort of to fill in different parts of it. I hope you will bear
with us in regard to that.</p>

<p>Were you aware of the diary that your husband had written and the book
that he had typed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he hire a public stenographer to help him with his book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he wrote his in longhand. He started it in Russia. But
he had it retyped here because it had been in longhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And do you know about when he started to have it retyped here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We arrived in June. I think it was at the end of June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what happened to that book, or a copy of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the present time it is&mdash;I don't know where&mdash;the police
department or the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what was done with the diary? Do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know where it is now. I know that it was taken. But
where it is now, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It was taken by either the FBI or the Secret Service or the police
department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know that, because I was not at home when all these
things were taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you tell us about what you know about their being taken.
Were you away from home and someone else was there when various things
belonging to you and your husband were taken from the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know where this book was, whether it was at Mrs.
Paine's or in Lee's apartment, because I did not see it there. I was not at
Mrs. Paine's because I lived in a hotel at that time in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What hotel was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this diary kept by your husband daily, so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, Russia first.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me that he did not continue it here, that he had
completed it in Russia. Not everything, but most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was it in his own handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have told us about an interview with the FBI, when your
husband went out into the car and spent a couple of hours, in August of 1962.
Do you recall whether there was an FBI interview earlier than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, there wasn't. At least I don't know about it. Perhaps
there was such a meeting, perhaps at the time we were in Fort Worth somebody
had come, when we lived with Robert. One reporter wanted to interview Lee
but Lee would not give the interview, and perhaps the FBI came, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The particular interview that I am asking you about was
June 26, according to information from the FBI.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know about it. The first time I knew about the FBI
coming was when we lived in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What rental did you pay on Mercedes Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any difficulties while you were on Mercedes Street
with your husband&mdash;that is, any quarreling there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only in connection with his mother, because of his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you having any problems about finances there, on Mercedes
Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course we did not live in luxury. We did not buy anything
that was not absolutely needed, because Lee had to pay his debt to Robert and
to the government. But it was not particularly difficult. At least on that basis
we had not had any quarrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you tell us about De Mohrenschildt? Was he a close
friend of your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee did not have any close friends, but at least he had&mdash;here in
America&mdash;he had a great deal of respect for De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you describe that relationship. Did they see each other
often?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not very frequently. From time to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband tell you why he had so much respect for
De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because he considered him to be smart, to be full of joy of
living, a very energetic and very sympathetic person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We had a report <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. It was pleasant to meet with him. He would bring
some pleasure and better atmosphere when he came to visit&mdash;with his dogs&mdash;he
is very loud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you like him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Him and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand any of the conversations between your
husband and De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they were held in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they discuss politics or the Marxist philosophy or anything
of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Being men, of course, sometimes they talked about politics, but
they did not discuss Marxist philosophy. They spoke about current political
events.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they have any discussions about President Kennedy or the
Government in the United States at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, only George said that before she got married he knew
Jackie Kennedy, that she was a very good, very sympathetic woman. Then he
was writing a book, that is George, and with reference to that book he had
written a letter to President Kennedy. This was with reference to the fact that
John Kennedy had recommended physical exercise, walking and so on, and
De Mohrenschildt and his wife had walked to the Mexican border. And he
hoped that John Kennedy would recommend his book.</p>

<p>I don't know&mdash;perhaps this is foolishness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything, or either of them say anything about
President Kennedy at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing bad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you referred to George, did you mean Mr. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I generally didn't believe him, that he had written a
book. Sometimes he could say so, but just for amusement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did De Mohrenschildt have a daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had several daughters, and many wives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was one of his daughters named Taylor, her last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. That is a daughter of his first marriage.
At the present time, I think he has&mdash;that is his fourth wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what was <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems that that is the last one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was her husband's name&mdash;the Taylor daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Gary Taylor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the Gary Taylors?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, at one time when I had to visit the dentist in Dallas, and
I lived in Fort Worth, I came to Dallas and I stayed with them for a couple
of days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know about when that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. October or November, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Gary Taylor help you to move your things at one time,
move you and your daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he moved our things from Fort Worth to Dallas, to Elsbeth
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he help you to move to Mrs. Hall's at any time, anyone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he did not move me to Mrs. Hall. But sometimes he came
for a visit. Once or twice I think he came when we lived&mdash;to Mrs. Hall's, and
once when we lived on Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he do when he came? Were those just visits?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, just visits. Just visits, with his wife and child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When the De Mohrenschildts came to the house and you showed
them the rifle, did you say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps I did say something to him, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything like "Look what my crazy one has done?
Bought a rifle" or something of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This sounds like something I might say. Perhaps I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In the period of October 1962, you did spend some time with
Mrs. Hall, did you not, in her home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us about how that happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When Lee found work in Dallas, Elena Hall proposed that I
stay with her for some time, because she was alone, and I would be company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did that have anything to do with any quarrels with your
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During that period of October of 1962, when your husband went
to Dallas to get work, do you know where he lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know that for&mdash;at first, for some time he stayed at the YMCA,
but later he rented an apartment, but I don't know at what address. Because
in the letters which he wrote me, the return address was a post office box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he stayed during that period part of the
time with Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you live while your husband was looking for work
and staying at the YMCA and at this apartment that you referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he stayed at the YMCA he had already found work, and
I was in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where in Fort Worth were you staying then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With Mrs. Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you notice a change, psychologically, in your husband during
this period in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first notice that change?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At&mdash;at Elsbeth Street, in Dallas. After the visit of the FBI,
in Fort Worth. He was for some time nervous and irritable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he seem to have two different personalities then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you describe to the Commission what he did to cause you
to think that he was changing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Generally he was&mdash;usually he was quite as he always was. He
used to help me. And he was a good family man. Sometimes, apparently without
reason, at least I did not know reasons, if any existed, he became quite a
stranger. At such times it was impossible to ask him anything. He simply
kept to himself. He was irritated by trifles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any of the trifles that irritated him, so as to
help us to know the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is hard to remember any such trifling occurrences, sometimes
such a small thing as, for example, dinner being five minutes late, and I do
mean five minutes&mdash;it is not that I am exaggerating&mdash;he would be very angry.
Or if there were no butter on the table, because he hadn't brought it from the
icebox, he would with great indignation ask, "Why is there no butter?" And
at the same time if I had put the butter on the table he wouldn't have touched it.</p>

<p>This is foolishness, of course. A normal person doesn't get irritated by things
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I do not ask these questions to pry into your
personal affairs, but it gives us some insight into what he did and why he
might have done the things he did.</p>

<p>I hope you understand that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you tell us a little about when he did beat you because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
we have reports that at times neighbors saw signs of his having beat you, so
that we might know the occasions and why he did such things.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The neighbors simply saw that because I have a very sensitive
skin, and even a very light blow would show marks. Sometimes it was my own
fault. Sometimes it was really necessary to just leave him alone. But I wanted
more attention. He was jealous. He had no reason to be. But he was jealous
of even some of my old friends, old in the sense of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he became jealous, did he discuss that with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Basically, that I prefer others to him. That I want many things which he
cannot give me. But that was not so. Once we had a quarrel because I had a
young man who was a boyfriend&mdash;this was before we were married, a boy who
was in love with me, and I liked him, too. And I had written him a letter from
here. I had&mdash;I wrote him that I was very lonely here, that Lee had changed a
great deal, and that I was sorry that I had not married him instead, that it
would have been much easier for me. I had mailed that letter showing the
post office box as a return address. But this was just the time when the postage
rates went up by one cent, and the letter was returned. Lee brought that letter
and asked me what it was and forced me to read it. But I refused. Then he
sat down across from me and started to read it to me. I was very much ashamed
of my foolishness. And, of course, he hit me, but he did not believe that this
letter was sincere. He asked me if it was true or not, and I told him that it was
true. But he thought that I did it only in order to tease him. And that was
the end of it. It was a very ill-considered thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall anything more that he said at that time about
that matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course after he hit me, he said that I should be ashamed
of myself for saying such things because he was very much in love with me.
But this was after he hit me.</p>

<p>Generally, I think that was right, for such things, that is the right thing to
do. There was some grounds for it.</p>

<p>Please excuse me. Perhaps I talk too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you had your child baptized, did you discuss that with
your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I knew that Lee was not religious, and, therefore, I did not
tell him about it. I lived in Fort Worth at that time, while he lived in Dallas.</p>

<p>But when June was baptized, I told him about it, and he didn't say anything
about it. He said it was my business. And he said, "Okay, if you wish." He
had nothing against it. He only took offense at the fact that I hadn't told him
about it ahead of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you a member of any church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe in God, of course, but I do not go to church&mdash;first
because I do not have a car. And, secondly, because there is only one Russian
Church. Simply that I believe in God in my own heart, and I don't think it is
necessary to visit the church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While your husband&mdash;or while you were visiting the Halls,
did your husband tell you about getting his job in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I knew about it before he left for Dallas, that he already
had work there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall whether your husband rented the apartment in
Dallas about November 3, 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had told me that he rented a room, not an apartment. But
that was in October.</p>

<p>What date I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And had he obtained an apartment before you went to Dallas
to live with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Cleaned everything up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So that you would have gone to Dallas to live with him some
time on or about the date that he rented that apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you went to live with him in the apartment at Dallas, did
you separate from him again and go to live with somebody else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only after this quarrel. Then I stayed with my friends for
one week. I had already told you about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the Meller matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that you called Mrs. Meller and told her about
your husband beating you and she told you to get a cab and come to stay with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, but he didn't beat me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you didn't tell her that he had beat you, either?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't think so. Perhaps she understood it that he had beaten
me, because it had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us any more exact account of where your husband
stayed in the period between October 10 and November 18, 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember his exact address. This was a period when
I did not live with him.</p>

<p>I am asking about which period is it. I don't remember the dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The period that he rented the apartment was November 3, so
that shortly after that, as I understood your testimony, you were with him,
from November 3, or about November 3 on to the 18th. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From November 3 to November 18, 1962? On Elsbeth Street?
No, I was there longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And do you recall the date that you went to Mrs. Hall's, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't remember. The day when he rented the apartment
was a Sunday. But where he lived before that, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you went to live with him in the apartment, around
November 3, how long did you stay before you went to live with your friend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately a month and a half. Perhaps a month. I
am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when you were at Fort Worth, and he was living in Dallas,
did he call you from time to time on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he called me and he wrote letters and sometimes he came
for a visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And during that time, did he tell you where he was staying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he said that he had rented a room, but he did not tell me
his address.</p>

<p>I want to help you, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think there was something in your husband's life in
America, his friends and so forth, that caused him to be different here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he had no friends who had any influence over him. He
himself had changed by comparison to the way he was in Russia. But what the
reason for that was, I don't know.</p>

<p>Am I giving sufficient answers to your questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are doing fine.</p>

<p>Did your consideration of a divorce from your husband have anything to do
with his ideas and political opinions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. The only reasons were personal ones with reference to
our personal relationship, not political reasons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In your story you say that what was involved was some of his
crazy ideas and political opinions. Can you tell us what you meant by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was after the case, after the matter of the divorce. I
knew that Lee had such political leanings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. With regard to your Russian friends, did you find the time
when they came less to see you and didn't show as much interest in you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us about the time, just approximately when you
noticed that difference?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Soon after arriving in Dallas. Mostly it was De Mohrenschildt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
who visited us. He was the only one who remained our friend. The others sort
of removed themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because they saw that Lee's attitude towards them was not
very proper, he was not very hospitable, and he was not glad to see them.
They felt that he did not like them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe what you observed that caused you to think
this, or how your husband acted in regard to these friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me that he did not like them, that he did not want
them to come to visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he show any signs of that attitude towards them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he was not very talkative when they came for a visit.
Sometimes he would even quarrel with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he quarreled with them, was it in regard to political
ideas or what subjects?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they would not agree with him when he talked on
political matters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any conversation that you can describe to us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course it is difficult to remember all the conversations.
But I know that they had a difference of opinion with reference to political
matters. My Russian friends did not approve of everything. I am trying to
formulate it more exactly. They did not like the fact that he was an American
who had gone to Russia. I think that is all. All that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did they say <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. Simply I would be busy, and I didn't listen to
the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you recall anything else about the conversation or the
substance of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first consider the possibility of returning to the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never considered that, but I was forced to because Lee insisted
on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you considered it, as you were forced to, by his insistence,
do you know when it was with reference to your first request to the Embassy,
which was February 17, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. February 17?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was a couple of weeks before that, at the beginning
of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband know about the letter you sent to the
Embassy on February 17?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course. He handed me the paper, a pencil, and said, "Write."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you what to put in the letter, or was that your own
drafting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I knew myself what I had to write, and these were my
words. What could I do if my husband didn't want to live with me? At least
that is what I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever have arguments with your husband about smoking
and drinking wine, other things like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About drinking wine, no. But he didn't like the fact that I
smoked, because he neither smoked nor drank. It would have been better if
he had smoked and drank.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us approximately when you first met Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Soon after New Years&mdash;I think it was in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would that be 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you describe the circumstances when you met her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were invited, together with George De Mohrenschildt
and his wife, to the home of his friend, an American. And Ruth was acquainted
with that American. She was also visiting there. And there were
a number of other people there, Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was this friend? Do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember his last name. If you would suggest, perhaps
I could say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that Mr. Glover?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Everett.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I don't know his last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you talk to Mrs. Paine in Russian at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A little, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine ever visit you at Elsbeth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Neely, on Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But not at Elsbeth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We moved soon after that acquaintance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did your husband treat June? Was he a good father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes, very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you notice any difference in his attitude towards your
child after you saw this change in his personality?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe to the Commission how your husband treated
the baby, and some of his acts, what he did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He would walk with June, play with her, feed her, change
diapers, take photographs&mdash;everything that fathers generally do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He showed considerable affection for her at all times, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. If I would punish June, he would punish me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first meet Michael Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After I became acquainted with Ruth and she visited me for
the first time, she asked me to come for a visit to her. This was on a Friday.
Her husband, Michael, came for us and drove us to their home in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They were living together at that time, were they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Michael Paine know Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At the time of the Walker incident, do you recall whether your
husband had his job or had lost it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You had said that this had happened on a Wednesday, and it
seems to me that it was on a Friday that he was told that he was discharged.
He didn't tell me about it until Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But it was on the preceding Friday that he was discharged,
was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not the preceding Friday&mdash;the Friday after the incident.
That is what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If he had lost his job before the Walker incident, you didn't
know it then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On the day of the Walker shooting did he appear to go to work
as usual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did he return that day, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Late at night, about 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He did not come home for dinner then, before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he had come home, and then left again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you notice any difference in his actions when he returned
home and had dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he appear to be excited, nervous?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he was quite calm. But it seemed to me that inside he was
tense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How could you tell that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I could tell by his face. I knew Lee. Sometimes when some
thing would happen he wouldn't tell me about it, but I could see it in his eyes,
that something had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you saw it this day, did you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did he leave the home after dinner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was about 7. Perhaps 7:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you observe whether he took any gun with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He went downstairs. We lived on the second floor. He
said, "Bye-bye."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you look to see if the gun had been taken when he did not
return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I didn't look to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, we have gone our hour.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. I think we will take a 10 minute recess now, so you
might refresh yourself.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.
Mr. Rankin, you may continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you told us about your knowledge about the trip
to Mexico and said that you were under oath and were going to tell us all
about what you knew.</p>

<p>Did your husband ever ask you not to disclose what you knew about the
Mexican trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Before he left. I had remained and he was supposed to leave
on the next day, and he warned me not to tell anyone about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After he returned to Dallas from his Mexico trip, did he say
anything to you then about not telling he had been to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he asked me whether I had told Ruth about it or anyone
else, and I told him no, and he said that I should keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 1 for identification, and ask you if you
recall seeing that document before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, this is the note that I found in connection with the
Walker incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That you already testified about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And there is attached to it a purported English translation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you want that marked and introduced at this time, Mr.
Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, I would like to offer the document.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The document may be marked Exhibit 1 and offered in
evidence.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 1, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what your husband meant when he said on that
note, "The Red Cross also will help you."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand that if he were arrested and my money would run
out, I would be able to go to the Red Cross for help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you ever discussed that possibility before you found the
note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why he left you the address book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because it contained the addresses and telephone numbers of
his and my friends in Russia and here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you had seen that book before and knew its contents, did
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 2 for identification and ask you if you
know what that is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not that is a photograph of the Walker
house in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't see it&mdash;at least&mdash;taken from this view I can't recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
it. I know that the photograph of Walker's home which I saw showed a
two-story house. But I don't recognize it from this view. I never saw the house
itself at any time in my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Does Exhibit 2 for identification appear to be the picture that
you described yesterday of the Walker house that you thought your husband
had taken and put in his book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Perhaps this was in his notebook. But I don't remember
this particular one.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Rankin, do you want this in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, she hasn't been able to identify that sufficiently.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. Perhaps there are some other photographs there
that I might be able to recognize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will present some more to you, and possibly you can then pick
out the Walker house.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know these photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I now hand you a photograph which has been labeled Exhibit
4 for identification. I ask if you can identify the subject of that photograph,
or those photographs.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Whichever ones you can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know one shows Walker's house. Another is a photograph
from Leningrad. P-3&mdash;this is probably New Orleans. P-4&mdash;Leningrad. It is
a photograph showing the castle square in Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you point out by number the photograph of the Walker
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. P-2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether the photographs on Exhibit 4 for identification
were part of your husband's photographs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer Exhibit 4 for identification in evidence.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit 2, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is being offered&mdash;the whole of it, or just P-2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No, all of it&mdash;because she identified the others, too, as a part
of the photographs that belonged to her husband. And she pointed out P-2 as
being the Walker residence.</p>

<p>When did you first see this photograph of the Walker residence, P-2, in this
Exhibit 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After the Walker incident Lee showed it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And how did you know it was a photograph of the Walker
residence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 3 for identification. I ask you if you can
identify the photographs there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, these are all our photographs. P-1 is Walker's house.
P-4 and P-3 is a photograph showing me and a girlfriend of mine in Minsk,
after a New Year's party, on the morning, on January 1. Before I was married.
This was taken early in the morning, after we had stayed overnight in the
suburbs. P-5 shows Paul&mdash;Pavel Golovachev. He is assembling a television
set. He sent us this photograph. He is from Minsk. He worked in the same
factory as Lee did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us which one is the picture of the Walker house
on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. P-1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did you first see that exhibit, P-1, of Exhibit 3?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Together with the other one. P-2 and P-6, I know that they
are Lee's photographs, but I don't know what they depict.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you shown the P-1 photograph of that Exhibit 3 at the
same time you were shown the other one that you have identified regarding
the Walker house?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me that that is so. I don't remember exactly. It is
hard to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was that the evening after your husband returned from
the Walker shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. This was on one of the succeeding days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By succeeding, you mean within two or three days after the
shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Exhibit 3.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 3, and was
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember the photograph, the first one that you showed
me. I only assumed that was Walker's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But the other ones, you do remember those photographs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, the others I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you say you do not remember the picture of the Walker
house, you are referring to the Exhibit 2 for identification that we did not offer
in evidence, that I will show you now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that your husband showed you any other exhibits
that were pictures of the Walker house at the time he discussed the Walker
shooting with you, beyond those that I have shown you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I shall hand you <span class="locked">Exhibit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was some railroad&mdash;not just a photograph of a house.
Perhaps there were some others. There were several photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I shall hand you Exhibit 4 for <span class="locked">identification&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One photograph with a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. &mdash;&mdash;if you can recall the photographs on that exhibit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As for P-1 and P-2, I don't know what they are.</p>

<p>P-3, that is Lee in the Army.</p>

<p>P-4, I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>P-5, I did see this photograph with Lee&mdash;he showed it to me after the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When your husband showed you the photograph P-5, did he
discuss with you what that showed, how it related to the Walker shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I simply see that this is a photograph of a railroad. It
was in that book. And I guessed, myself, that it had some sort of relationship
to the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence photographs P-3 and P-5 on this exhibit.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted, and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 4, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, I shall hand you Exhibit 6 for identification and ask you
if you recognize those two photographs.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. These photographs I know, both of them. They seem
to be identical. Walker's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first see those exhibits?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About the same time that you saw the other pictures of the
Walker house that you have described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband tell you why he had these photographs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't tell me, but I guessed, myself&mdash;I concluded myself
that these photographs would help him in that business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the business of the shooting at the Walker house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence the two photographs in this exhibit.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 5, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you told the Commission about the Walker shooting,
and your knowledge, did you tell anyone else about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, to the members of the Secret Service and the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell your mother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I also told his mother about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you tell his mother about the incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After Lee was arrested, on Saturday&mdash;he was arrested on Friday.
I don't remember when I met with his mother&mdash;whether it was on the
same Friday&mdash;yes, Friday evening. I met her at the police station. From
there we went to Ruth Paine's where I lived at that time. And she remained
overnight, stayed overnight there. I had a photograph of Lee with the rifle,
which I gave. At that time I spoke very little English. I explained as best I
could about it. And that is why I showed her the photograph. And I told
her that Lee had wanted to kill Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, turning to the period when you were in New Orleans, did
you write to the Russian Embassy about going to Russia, returning to Russia
at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that about the first part of July, that you wrote?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then did you write a second letter to follow up the first one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 6 for identification and ask you if that is
the first letter that you sent to the Embassy. Take your time and look at it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was not the first letter, but it was the first letter written
from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you examine the photostat that has just been handed to
you, and tell us whether or not that was the first letter that you wrote to the
Embassy about this matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, this is a reply to my first letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you examine the one that you now have, and state whether
that is the first letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, this was the first. This was only the declaration. But
there was a letter in addition to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The declaration was a statement that you wished to return to
the Soviet Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, about granting me a visa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what date does that bear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is dated March 17, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you send it with your letter about the date that it bears?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I don't know&mdash;perhaps a little later, because I was not very anxious to send
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you did send it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And it might have been within a few days or a few weeks of that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do we have the date of the second letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I want to go step by step.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes, I understand. That is not introduced yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It might be confusing if we get them out of order.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, this is the first letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the photostatic document that you have just referred to as
being the first letter, does it bear a date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It says there the 17th of February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And do you know that that letter had attached to it your declaration
that you just referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it seems to me. Perhaps it was attached to the next letter.
I am not sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This letter of February 17 that you referred to as the first letter
is in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you examine the translation into English that is attached
to it and inform us whether or not that is a correct translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can't do that, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Interpreter, can you help us in that regard, and tell her
whether it is a correct translation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. If I may translate it from the English, she could check it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you kindly do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a quite correct translation. I didn't want to, but I had
to compose some such letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence the photostatic copy of the letter in Russian
as Exhibit 6.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Together with the translation that is attached to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Together with the translation that is attached to it as Exhibit 7.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit Nos. 6 and 7,
respectively, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you again the declaration, Exhibit 8, and ask you if that
accompanied the first letter, Exhibit 6, that you have referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember whether it accompanied the first letter or the
second letter with which I had enclosed some photographs and filled out questionnaires.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 9 and ask you if that is the second letter that
you have just referred to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, this was perhaps the third. Perhaps I could help you, if you
would show me all the letters, I would show you the sequence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 9, dated March 8, 1963, and ask you if
you can tell whether that is the letter which accompanied the declaration.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a reply from the Embassy, a reply to my first letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, may we have a short recess to get the original
exhibits that we have prepared, and I think we can expedite our hearing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well. We will have a short recess.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will come to order. We will proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, we will see if we have these in proper order now.</p>

<p>I will call your attention to the photostats of the declaration and the accompanying
papers that I shall now call Exhibit 8 to replace the references to Exhibit
8 and 9 that we made in prior testimony, and ask you to examine that and see if
they were sent together by you to the Embassy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I sent this after I received an answer from the Embassy, an
answer to my first letter. This is one and the same. Two separate photostats
of the same declaration. All of these documents were attached to my second
letter after the answer to my first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I call your attention to Exhibit 9, and ask you if that is the
answer to your first letter that you have just referred to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, this is the answer to that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you compare the translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only thing is that the address and the telephone number
of the Embassy are not shown in the Russian original. They are in the
translation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Otherwise the translation is correct, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Otherwise, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I ask leave to substitute the Exhibit No. 8 for
what I have called 9, as the reply of the Embassy, so that we won't be confused
about the order of these.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The correction may be made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence the original and the translation of Exhibit 8,
except for the address of the Embassy, which was not on the original.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted, and take the next number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 8, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, as I understand, what I will call Exhibit 9 now, to correct
the order in which these letters were sent to the Embassy, was your response
to the letter of the Embassy dated March 8, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you compare the translation with the interpreter and
advise us if it is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. It says, "Application" in the translation; the Russian word is
"Declaration".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you note that correction, Mr. Krimer, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. In pencil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. Crossing out the word "application".</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. Sir, this was a printed questionnaire, and there is a translator
note on here which states that since printed questions are given both in Russian
and English translation, only the answer portion of the document is being
translated.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have now examined Exhibit 9 and the translation into
English from that exhibit where it was in Russian and compared them with
the interpreter, have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you find the translation is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 9, being the Russian communications,
and the English translations.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The documents may be admitted with the next number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 9, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you recall that in the letter from the Embassy
of March 8, which is known as Commission's Exhibit 8, that you were told that
the time of processing would take 5 to 6 months?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss that with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And about when did you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What is the date of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. March 8.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time we did not discuss it. We discussed it in New
Orleans. Or more correctly, we thought that if everything is in order, I would
be able to leave before the birth of my second child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you discuss that idea with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you think that you discussed it with him while you were
at New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that it is also requested in the letter of March
8 from the Embassy, Commission's Exhibit 8, that you furnish one or two letters
from relatives residing in the Soviet Union who were inviting you to live with
them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, but I didn't have any such letters and I did not enclose any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You never did send such letters to the Embassy, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you sent Exhibit 9 to the Embassy, did you have further
correspondence with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 10, a letter purporting to be from the
Embassy dated April 18, and ask you if you recall that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you please compare the translation with the Russian?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, the translation is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer the exhibit in evidence, together with the translation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted with the next number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 10, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you note that the Embassy invited you to come and visit
them personally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you a letter purporting to be from the Embassy, dated
June 4, marked Exhibit 11, and ask you if you recall receiving that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This is a second request to visit the Embassy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you please compare the translation with the Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 11, being the Russian letter from
the Embassy together with the English translation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 11, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will now recess for lunch.</p>

<p>The Commission will reconvene at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will convene.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, you may continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I will now give you Exhibit 12 to examine and ask
you to compare the Russian with the English translation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The translation is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 12, being the Russian letter, and the
English translation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The documents are admitted under that number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 12, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, this Exhibit 13 that you have just examined in Russian, is
that your letter, Mrs. Oswald, to the Embassy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Is that No. 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And is it in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you find any date on the letter? I didn't.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I probably didn't date it. No. I wrote this from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell the Commission the approximate date you wrote it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What was the date of the preceding letter, No. 11&mdash;Exhibit
No. 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. June 4, 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was probably in July, but I don't know the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you notice there was a "P.S." on Exhibit 12?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Referring to an application by your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was an application for your husband for a visa included or
enclosed with Exhibit 12 when you sent it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee told me that he had sent an application, but it was he
who put this letter in an envelope and addressed it, so I don't know whether it
was there or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when you say that it was he that put the letter into the
envelope and addressed it, you mean this Exhibit 12, that was a letter that you
had written?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do I understand you correctly that you do not know whether
his application was included because he handled the mailing of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 13 and ask you if you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember this. He did not write this in my presence.
But it is Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Krimer, will you please translate it for her so she will know
the contents.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Why "separately"&mdash;the word "separately" here is underlined.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I was going to ask you. But since you have not seen it before,
I guess you cannot help us.</p>

<p>Is this the first time that you knew that he had ever asked that his visa be
handled separately from yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I didn't know this. Because I hadn't seen this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 13.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 13, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is the word "separately" the last word of the letter that you
are referring to&mdash;that is the word that you asked about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Was that underlined by Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the way we received it, Mrs. Oswald. We assume it
was underlined by your husband. We know that it was not underlined by the
Commission, and no one in the Government that had anything to do with it has
ever told us that they had anything to do with underlining it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that perhaps he asked for that visa to be considered
separately because the birth of the child might complicate matters, and perhaps
he thought it would speed it up if they do consider it separately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In connection with that thought, I will hand you Exhibit 14, and
ask you to examine that and tell us whether you have seen that before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you please compare the translation in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, the translation is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence the letter in Russian, Exhibit 14, and the
English translation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted under that number.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 14, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any impression that your husband may not have
planned to go back to Russia himself, but was merely trying to arrange for you
and your daughter to go back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time I did not think so, but now I think perhaps.
Because he planned to go to Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By that you mean you think he may have planned to go to Cuba
and never go beyond Cuba, but stay in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that in time he would have wanted to come and see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 15 and ask you whether you remember
having seen that before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell whether your husband's handwriting is on that
exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The signature is his, yes. I would like to have it translated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you translate it for her, please, Mr. Krimer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A crazy letter. Perhaps from this I could conclude that he did
want to go to the Soviet Union&mdash;but now I am lost, I don't know. Because&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>perhaps
because nothing came out of his Cuban business, perhaps that is why
he decided to go to the Soviet Union. The letter is not too polite, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 15.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 15, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I think in the examination about this letter,
if I would circulate it to the Commission it would be a little clearer what it is
all about&mdash;if you could have a moment or two to examine it, I think it would
help in your understanding of the examination.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was typed on the typewriter belonging to Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You can tell that by the looks of the typing, can you, Mrs.
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know, but I know that he was typing there. I
don't know what he was typing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And it is Ruth Paine's typewriter that you are referring to, when
you say Ruth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ruth Paine. Because Lee did not have a typewriter, and it is
hardly likely that he would have had it typed somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 16, which purports to be the envelope for
the letter, Exhibit 15. Have you ever seen that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The envelope I did see. I did not see the letter, but I did see
the envelope. Lee had retyped it some 10 times or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall or could you clarify for us about the date on the
envelope&mdash;whether it is November 2 or November 12?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. November 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 16.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 16, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I might call your attention, Mrs. Oswald, to the fact that Exhibit
15, the letter, is dated November 9. Does that help you any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Then this must be 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the only way you can determine it, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the mailing of this letter,
Exhibit 15?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yesterday you testified to the fact that your husband told you
about his trip to Mexico when he returned, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where were you when he told you about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the home of Mrs. Paine, in my room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anyone other than yourself and your husband present
when he told you about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us in as much detail as you can remember just what
he said about the trip at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Everything that I could remember I told you yesterday. I don't
remember any more about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But I asked him that we not go to Russia, I told him that I
did not want to, and he said, "Okay."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was in this same conversation, after he had told you about
the trip to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he asked you not to tell anyone about the trip to Mexico,
did he tell you why he asked you to do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I knew that he was secretive, and that he loved to make
secrets of things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know the Comrade Kostin that is referred to in this
letter of November 8, Exhibit 15?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never wrote to him. I don't know. I don't know where he
got that name from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband say anything about Comrade Kostin and his
visit with him at the embassy in Mexico City, when he told you about the trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He did not name him. He didn't tell me his name. But he
told me he was a very pleasant, sympathetic person, who greeted him, welcomed
him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband say anything to you about what he meant
when he said he could not take a chance on requesting a new visa unless he used
a real name, so he returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he didn't tell me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand that he had used any assumed name about
going to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He never told you anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. After Lee returned from Mexico, I lived in Dallas, and
Lee gave me his phone number and then when he changed his apartment&mdash;Lee
lived in Dallas, and he gave me his phone number. And then when he moved,
he left me another phone number.</p>

<p>And once when he did not come to visit during the weekend, I telephoned him
and asked for him by name&mdash;rather, Ruth telephoned him and it turned out
there was no one there by that name. When he telephoned me again on Monday,
I told him that we had telephoned him but he was unknown at that number.</p>

<p>Then he said that he had lived there under an assumed name. He asked me
to remove the notation of the telephone number in Ruth's phone book, but I
didn't want to do that. I asked him then, "Why did you give us a phone number,
when we do call we cannot get you by name?"</p>

<p>He was very angry, and he repeated that I should remove the notation of the
phone number from the phone book. And, of course, we had a quarrel. I told
him that this was another of his foolishness, some more of his foolishness. I
told Ruth Paine about this. It was incomprehensible to me why he was so
secretive all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he give you any explanation of why he was using an assumed
name at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he did not want his landlady to know his real
name because she might read in the paper of the fact that he had been in Russia
and that he had been questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing. And also he did not want the FBI to know where
he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why he did not want the FBI to know where he
lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because their visits were not very pleasant for him and he
thought that he loses jobs because the FBI visits the place of his employment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, if he was using an assumed name during the trip in Mexico,
you didn't know about it, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't know, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before the trip to Mexico, did your husband tell you that he did
not expect to contact the Soviet Embassy there about the visa?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he was going to visit the Soviet Embassy, but
more for the purpose of getting to Cuba, to try to get to Cuba. I think that was
more than anything a masking of his purpose. He thought that this would help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean it was a masking of his purpose to visit the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico, or to write it in this letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't understand the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You noticed where he said in this letter "I had not planned to
contact the Soviet Embassy in Mexico," did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Why hadn't he planned that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is what I am trying to find out from you.</p>

<p>Did he ever tell you that he didn't plan to visit the Soviet Embassy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is not the truth. He did want to contact the embassy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And he told you before he went to Mexico that he planned to
visit the Soviet Embassy, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say to you before he went to Mexico that he planned
to communicate with the Soviet Embassy in Havana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he said that if he would be able to get to Cuba, with the
intention of living there, he would get in touch with the Soviet Embassy for the
purpose of bringing me there. Or for him to go to Russia. Because sometimes
he really sincerely wanted to go to Russia and live and sometimes not.
He did not know, himself. He was very changeable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But in Exhibit 15, Mrs. Oswald, he refers to the fact that he
hadn't been able to reach the Soviet Embassy in Havana as planned, and then
he says, "The Embassy there would have had time to complete our business."</p>

<p>Now, did he discuss that at all with you before he went to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. If he said in Mexico City that he wanted to visit the
Soviet Embassy in Havana, the reason for it was only that he thereby would
be able to get to Cuba.</p>

<p>Is this understandable? Does this clarify the matter or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The difficulty, Mrs. Oswald, with my understanding of Exhibit 15
is that he purports to say, as I read the letter, that if he had been able to
reach the Soviet Embassy in Havana, he would have been able to complete
his business about the visa, and he wouldn't have had to get in touch with
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City at all.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The thing is that one cannot go to Cuba&mdash;that the only legal
way is via Mexico City. And, therefore, he went to the Soviet Embassy there
in Mexico City and told them that he wanted to visit the Soviet Embassy in
Havana, but only for the purpose of getting into Cuba.</p>

<p>I don't think he would have concluded his business there. I don't think
that you understand that Lee has written that letter in a quite involved manner.
It is not very logical. I don't know whether it is clear to you or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I appreciate, Mrs. Oswald, your interpretation of it.</p>

<p>I was trying to find out also whether your husband had told you anything
about what he meant or what he did or whether he had tried to contact the
Embassy in Havana, as he says in this letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I don't know of this letter. I only know that Lee
wanted to get to Cuba by any means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then he next proceeds to say, "Of course the Soviet Embassy
was not at fault. They were, as I say, unprepared". As I read that, I understand
that he was trying to let the Embassy in Washington know that the
Mexico City Embassy had not been notified by him, and, therefore, was
unprepared.</p>

<p>Now, did he say anything like that to you after his return to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Why did the Embassy in Washington have to notify the
Embassy in Mexico City that Lee Oswald was arriving?</p>

<p>It is not that I am asking. It seems to me that this is not a normal thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The question is did he say anything to you about it when he
got back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that when he went to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City they had promised him that they would write a letter to the Embassy
in Washington.</p>

<p>Please excuse me, but it is very difficult for me to read the involved
thoughts of Lee.</p>

<p>I think that he was confused himself, and I certainly am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that all that you can recall that was said about that matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then he goes on to <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. I only know that his basic desire was to get to
Cuba by any means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then in this Exhibit 15 he proceeds to say, "The Cuban Consulate
was guilty of a gross breach of regulations." Do you know what he
meant by that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What regulations&mdash;what are the regulations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I am trying to find out from you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know about that. I don't know what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say what regulations he thought were breached,
or that the Cuban Embassy didn't carry out regulations when he returned
from his trip and told you about what happened there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then he goes on to say in the Exhibit, "I am glad he has
since been replaced."</p>

<p>Do you know whom he was referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have no knowledge of it. I think that if the person to whom
this letter was addressed would read the letter he wouldn't understand anything,
either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Your husband goes on in Exhibit 15 to say, "The Federal Bureau
of Investigation is not now interested in my activities in the progressive
organization 'Fair Play for Cuba Committee' of which I was secretary in New
Orleans (State of Louisiana) since I no longer reside in that state."</p>

<p>Do you know why he would say anything like that to the Embassy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because he was crazy.</p>

<p>He wrote this in order to emphasize his importance. He was no secretary
of any&mdash;he was not a secretary of any organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know that he had received any inquiry from the Embassy
or anyone of the Soviet Union about the matters that he is telling about here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then he goes on to say, "However, the FBI has visited us
here in Dallas, Texas, on November 1. Agent James P. Hosty"&mdash;do you know
whether there was such a visit by that man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was he referring to the man that you know as James P.
Hosty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know his last name. He gave us his telephone number,
but it seems to me that his name was different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you received the telephone number, what did you do
with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He gave the telephone number to Ruth, and she, in turn, passed
it on to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he put it in a book or did anything
with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He took the note with him to Dallas. I don't know what he
did with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did the agent also give his license number for his car to Mrs.
Paine or to you or to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. But Lee had asked me that if an FBI agent were to call,
that I note down his automobile license number, and I did that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you give the license number to him when you noted it down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, he goes on to say that this agent, James P. Hosty "warned
me that if I engaged in FPCC activities in Texas the FBI will again take an
'interest' in me."</p>

<p>Do you remember anything about anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know why he said that in there, because if he has in
mind the man who visited us, that man had never seen Lee. He was talking to
me and to Mrs. Paine. But he had never met Lee. Perhaps this is another
agent, not the one who visited us.</p>

<p>But I don't know whether Lee had talked to him or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether any FBI agent had ever warned your
husband that if he engaged in any Fair Play for Cuba activities in Texas, the
FBI would be again interested in him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then in the exhibit he goes on to say, "This agent also 'suggested'
to Marina Nichilyeva that she could remain in the United States under
FBI protection."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Did you ever hear of anything like that before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had not been proposed anything of the sort at any time.</p>

<p>The only thing the agent did say is that if I had ever any kind of difficulties or
troubles in the sense that someone would try to force me to do something, to
become an agent, then I should get in touch with him, and that if I don't want
to do this, that they would help me. But they never said that I live here and
that I must remain here under their protection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then in this Exhibit 15 he goes on to explain what he means by
the word "protection", saying "That is, she could defect from the Soviet Union,
of course." Do you remember anybody saying anything like that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, no one said anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anyone at any time, while you were in the United States,
suggest that you become an agent of any agency of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anyone from the Soviet Union suggest that you be an agent
for that government, or any of its agencies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, in this Exhibit 15, your husband goes on to say, "I and
my wife strongly protested tactics by the notorious FBI."</p>

<p>Do you know of any protest of that kind, or any action of that kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know of any protests, but simply that I said that I
would prefer not to get these visits, because they have a very exciting and
disturbing effect upon my husband. But it was not a protest. This was simply
a request.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you never made any protests against anyone asking you to
act as an agent or to defect to the United States because no one asked you that,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No one ever asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know of anything that you could tell the Commission in
regard to these matters in this letter, Exhibit 15, that would shed more light on
what your husband meant or what he was trying to do, that you have not
already told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Everything that I could tell you with reference to this letter I
have told you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think we will take a short recess now, about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would like to help you, but I simply don't know, I cannot.</p>

<p>(Brief recess)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, you may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I will hand you again Exhibit 14 and the translation
from the Russian and call your attention to the urgency of your request there.
I ask you, was that your idea to press for help from the Embassy in regard to the
visa, or your husband's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course my husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At the time of Exhibit 14, then, you were not anxious to return
to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never wanted to return but Lee insisted and there is nothing
else I could do. But sometimes when I wrote these letters, I felt very lonely&mdash;since
my husband didn't want me, I felt perhaps this would be the best way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the Spanish language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps five words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you given it any study?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I have a Spanish textbook of the Spanish language and I
had intended to study even while I was still in Russia, but I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband ever study Spanish that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't study it, but before his trip to Mexico he would sit
down with the textbook and look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 17 and ask you if you recall having seen
that before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I take it out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. June seems to have played with it. This was Lee's study
of Spanish perhaps because this was all photographed, it is soiled. Here I helped
Lee. I wrote some Spanish words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Does that Exhibit 17 have any of your husband's handwriting
on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Some of it is my handwriting and some of it is Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us when he was trying to study Spanish? Was
it at any time with regard to the time when he planned to go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About when did he start?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In August, in New Orleans, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And whatever he did in this notebook, Exhibit 17, he did at that
time or thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, this was in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he do whatever writing he did in connection with the study
of the Spanish language in Exhibit 17 at New Orleans in August or after that
date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Do you want to know whether this was earlier than August or later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not earlier. This was in September, not in August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he do anything in the writing of what is in Exhibit 17
in the study of the Spanish language at Dallas, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 17.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be marked with the next number and received in
evidence.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 17, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. How a simple notebook can become a matter of material evidence&mdash;the
Spanish words in it, and June's scribbling on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Returning to the time that your husband came back from Mexico
City to Dallas, can you tell us what type of luggage he brought back with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had a military type raincoat with him and a small bag
with a zipper, blue in color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As far as you recall he did not have two bags that he brought
back with him from Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he spend the first weekend of October 4 to 6 with you at
the Paines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not the whole weekend. When he returned he stayed overnight
and then he went to Dallas. But he returned on Saturday or Friday
evening. And he remained until Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you notice any change in your husband after this trip to
Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In my opinion, he was disappointed at not being able to get
to Cuba, and he didn't have any great desire to do so any more because he had
run into, as he himself said&mdash;into bureaucracy and red tape. And he changed
for the better. He began to treat me better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us how he treated you better?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He helped me more&mdash;although he always did help. But he was
more attentive. Perhaps this was because he didn't live together with me but
stayed in Dallas. Perhaps, also because we expected a child and he was in
somewhat an elated mood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband have any money with him when he returned
from Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he had some left. But I never counted how much money
he had in his wallet. That is why I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it a small or a large amount or do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What would be a large amount for me would not be a large
amount for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, can you give us any estimate of what you think he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He might have had $50 or $70, thereabouts. It is necessary
sometimes to make a joke. Otherwise, it gets boring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After the first weekend, after your husband returned, which he
spent at the Paines, as you have described, where did he live in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he rented a room in Oak Cliff, but I don't know the
address. I didn't ask, because I didn't need it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know that he lived with a Mrs. Bledsoe at any time in
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In what sense do you mean "lived with"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I mean roomed in her home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was a place on Marsallis Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he return from Irving to Dallas at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ruth met him at the bus station at that time and drove him
home. By bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said before that you learned about the depository job at
some neighbor's home, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In whose home was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know her last name. When you walk out of the Paine
house, it is the first house to the right. I am trying to remember. Perhaps
later I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it the lady of that house who told you, or someone that
was a guest there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps you know the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We don't know the name of the lady next door. We know a
number of names, but not by the location.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Her first name is Dorothy. And there was another woman
there, another neighbor, who said that her brother worked at the depository, and
that as far as she knew, there was a vacancy there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what was the name of that neighbor whose brother worked
at the depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that Mrs. Randle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. I might know her first name if you mention it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there a Linnie Mae Randle that you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was she a sister of Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know such people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know a Mr. Frazier that had a job at the depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't know his name. I knew that it was a young man.
I don't think he was 18 yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was he the brother of this friend who was at the neighbor's
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And he was the one that your husband rode from Irving into
Dallas from time to time to go to work, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, after Lee was already working this boy would bring Lee
and take him back with him to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did he take him, ordinarily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he take him on Monday morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Usually each week he would take him on Monday morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When Lee came for a weekend, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then when did he bring him back from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At 5:30 on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband ever come in the middle of the week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, only during the last week when all of this happened with
reference to the assassination of the President&mdash;he came on a Thursday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine have anything to do with your husband getting
this job at the depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She had no direct connection with it, but an indirect connection,
of course. I lived with her and she talked to a neighbor and mentioned
that Lee was out of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it Mrs. Paine that found out about the job, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And she telephoned there and asked whether they had a
job available. They didn't say anything specific but they asked that Lee come
there on the following day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you find out whether your husband did go there the following
day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the following day he went there, had a talk with them, and
he telephoned that he had already received the job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he telephone to you or to Mrs. Paine about getting the job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He telephoned me. But, of course, he thanked Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did he start on the job? Was there two or three days
before he got the job and started, or more than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that he started on the day following being accepted for
the job. I think it was either on the 14th, 15th, or 16th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he was staying at Mrs. Bledsoe's rooming house, did he
call you and give you the number there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall where he was when he gave this fictitious name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What do you mean where he was? From where he telephoned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, or the number that he gave you&mdash;that is the rooming house
that he was at when he used this fictitious name, and you told us you called
there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He lived at first in one place, and then he changed. It was
the last place where he had given a fictitious name. I don't know what name
he lived under in the first place, because I never telephoned him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the name that he lived under in the second place,
when you did call him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't remember the fictitious name that he gave you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I read in the paper after everything happened, but at that time
I didn't know. He said that his last name was Lee. He didn't say that. I read
that in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did that remind you, then, that that was the name they gave
you when you called and he answered the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, no one told me anything. I didn't know under what name
he lived there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you found out that he was not living under his own name, is
that what you meant before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After he got his job, did he return the next weekend to see you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember whether that time he returned was on Friday
or Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was on Friday, October 18. It was his birthday.</p>

<p>He stopped with Ruth. On Sunday I went to the hospital, and he stayed
overnight from Monday until Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After your husband returned from Mexico, did you examine
the rifle in the garage at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had never examined the rifle in the garage. It was wrapped
in a blanket and was lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever check to see whether the rifle was in the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never checked to see that. There was only once that I was
interested in finding out what was in that blanket, and I saw that it was a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About a week after I came from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then you found that the rifle was in the blanket, did you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I saw the wooden part of it, the wooden stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On the weekend before your husband got his job at the depository,
did he spend that with you at the Paines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he come home Friday or Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On a Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he returned to Dallas on Monday, the 14th of October,
did he tell you he was going to change his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember what your husband's pay was at the
depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me that it was also $1.25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About how much a month did it run?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me it was $210 to $230.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the hours that he worked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems that&mdash;it seems to me that it was from 8:30 a.m. to
5 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he work the weekend or any overtime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. It does happen in that depository that they work overtime.
But he did not have to work any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During the week when he was in Dallas and you were at Irving,
did he call you from time to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Daily, twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he leave his telephone number in Dallas with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>I don't have it, it was in Paine's notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he speak to you in Russian when he called you on the
telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Sometimes he would try to speak in English when someone
was listening, and he didn't want them to know he spoke Russian&mdash;then
he would try to speak in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever speak in Spanish when he was talking to you from
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He doesn't speak Spanish. I don't either. His landlady
heard him say "Adios" and she decided that he spoke Spanish, because she
didn't understand that he had spoken Russian all that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a special celebration for your husband's birthday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On October 18th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ruth and her children, I, Lee, and Paine's husband, Michael.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Wesley Frazier bring your husband home at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Frazier is the last name? Wesley was that boy's name. I now
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he bring him home that weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>It seems to me, yes. It is hard to remember now which weekend was which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On these weekends, did you ever observe your husband going
to the garage, practicing with the rifle in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you see him leave the house when he could have been going
to the garage and practicing with his rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he couldn't have practiced while we were at the Paine's,
because Ruth was there. But whenever she was not at home, he tried to spend
as much time as he could with me&mdash;he would watch television in the house.
But he did go to the garage to look at our things that were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you don't know when he went there what he might have
done with the rifle? Is that what you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At least I didn't notice anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you have described your <span class="locked">husband's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. I think that it takes considerable time to practice
with a rifle. He never spent any great deal of time in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have described your husband's practicing on the back porch
at New Orleans with the telescopic scope and the rifle, saying he did that very
regularly there.</p>

<p>Did you ever see him working the bolt, that action that opens the rifle, where
you can put a shell in and push it back&mdash;during those times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not see it, because it was dark, and I would be in the room
at that time.</p>

<p>But I did hear the noise from it from time to time&mdash;not often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the weekend that you went to the hospital for
your baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband go with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Ruth drove me at that time. He remained with June because
June was crying and we could not leave her with strangers. He wanted
to go with me, but we couldn't arrange it any other way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After the baby was born, did he come and see you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything to you about the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Every father talks a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he talk about the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About me and the child&mdash;he was very happy. He even had
tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he call you from Irving when you were in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he was working at that time, and he called me from work.
But I didn't talk to him. He merely asked the nurse how I was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And those conversations would be reported to you by the
nurse, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, she didn't tell me about them. Because he telephoned
to find out when I should be brought home, and he telephoned Ruth and
asked her to let him know. But the nurse did tell me that my husband
had called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the weekend of October 25th to the 27th, did your
husband return to Irving that weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There were some weekends when he did not come. But this
was at my request. It happened twice, I think. One such weekend was
the occasion of the birthday of Mrs. Paine's daughter. And I knew that
Lee didn't like Michael, Mrs. Paine's husband, and I asked him not to come.</p>

<p>This was one occasion.</p>

<p>The other I don't recall. I don't recall the date of this. But I remember
that the weekend before he shot at the President, he did not come on Saturday
and Sunday. Because we had a quarrel&mdash;that incident with the fictitious
name.</p>

<p>No, I am confused.</p>

<p>It would be easier for me to remember if I knew the birthday of that
girl. Perhaps you know. Perhaps you have it noted down somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are asking me the birthday of Mrs. Paine's daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because I know that the FBI questioned me about it, and
they had made a note about it. Because they wanted to determine each
time when he did come and when did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, if it was the weekend of November 16th and 17th that
he remained in Dallas, would that help you as to the time of the birthday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This was the weekend before the 21st, and he had
not come home that weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the neighbor next door that you referred to, where
you learned about the job with the depository, could that have been Dorothy
Roberts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that your husband went to some meeting with
Michael Paine in October of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>It seems to me&mdash;I know for sure that this was one of the Fridays. It
seems to me that this was the birthday&mdash;it was after dinner. They talked
in English. I don't know about what. I know that they got together and
went to some kind of a meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ruth said something about that, but I didn't understand anything.
This was right after the incident with Stevenson, who was hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that in the weekend of October 25th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, probably. This was not Lee's birthday. It was the
week after that, the following Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, on October 26th, Saturday, was your husband with you
all day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. All day. Whenever he came, he never went anywhere
else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We had some information that a telescopic sight was fitted to a
gun for your husband on that date, and that is why I am asking you if
there was any time that he could have left to have that done.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. How is it about the telescope? He always had the telescope.
Were there two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We are trying to find out.</p>

<p>Someone says that they mounted a sight.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is not the truth, if they say that. Simply people talking.
Perhaps someone who looked like Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Someone may be mistaken and thought that he had mounted
a telescopic sight when he did it for someone else. And that is why we
want to check with you.</p>

<p>When your husband went back to work on Monday, October 28th, did he
drive with Wesley Frazier at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems&mdash;it seems that he had overslept and that someone
else had picked him up. But, no&mdash;no, I remember that he did not come to get
him, but Lee met him near his house. Lee told me that. Or his sister. I don't
remember. Lee told me about it. But I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But he did not go in by bus that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He said his sister drove him to the bus. I only know
that this boy did not come to get him that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As far as you know, he may have gone all the way into Dallas
in a car, or he may have gone in a bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps he hadn't told him to pick him up on that day. I
don't know. I only know the fact that the boy did not pick him up on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We have reports of FBI interviews the last part of October,
that is October 29, and also November 1, and November 5. We would like to
ask you about them, since some of them may have been with Mrs. Paine in
your presence or with you.</p>

<p>Do you recall one on October 29th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember the interview. Ruth interpreted&mdash;she talked
to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In order that the Commission will understand, whenever the
FBI would try to ask you any questions, Mrs. Paine would interpret for you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And would she at the same time answer things in English, too,
herself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So, in effect, the FBI <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me&mdash;she loves to talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The FBI was interviewing both of you at the same time, to some
extent, is that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. They asked her about Lee, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that you did have such an interview at Mrs.
Paine's house when she acted as interpreter on November 1, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you present on November 5, 1963, when FBI agents Hosty
and Wilson interviewed Mrs. Paine at her home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was in my room at that time busy with little Rachel, and I
heard voices which I thought were voices of the FBI. I came out of the room
and they were in a hurry to leave. They did not talk to me at that time, other
than just a greeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not they had been talking to Mrs.
Paine about you or your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. She told me about it, but I was not especially interested.
She does not interpret quite exactly. She is hard to understand. But she told
me that in general terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have told us about the fact that you got the telephone
number of the FBI agent and gave it to your husband. Was that the November
1 interview when that happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 18, and ask you if you can identify
that for us, and tell us what it is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is your handwriting in that Exhibit 18?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It must be, yes, I will find mine. There are many different
handwritings in here. Different people have written in this notebook. Sometimes
Russian friends in Russia would note their address in this notebook.</p>

<p>This is mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us&mdash;is it a long notation by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. That is my aunt's address when Lee would remain in
Minsk while I went on vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is much of that notebook, Exhibit 18, in your husband's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The majority, mostly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Except for the page with your handwriting on it and the notations
of other friends that you referred to, is it generally in your husband's
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can tell exactly which is noted down by Lee and which is
noted down by others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And it is a regular notebook that he kept for all types of notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He started it in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And there are a number of notations that were made after you
returned to this country, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 18.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted with that number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 18, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There is a Russian term for "wedding ring" noted in there.
Before we were married I wrote that down for him, because he didn't know
the Russian expression for it. I didn't tell him. He looked it up in the dictionary
himself and translated it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I would like to hand this back to you and call your attention
to the page of Exhibit 18 where the little white slip is.</p>

<p>I ask you if you recognize the handwriting there, where it refers to Agent
Hosty.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee wrote that. And this is the license number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the telephone number?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
The license number, the name, and the telephone number are all in your
<span class="locked">husband's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The date when he visited him, FBI agent, telephone, name,
license number, and probably the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are all in your husband's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know when they were entered in that notebook, Exhibit
18?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After the first visit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you note the notation "November 1" on that page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that is about the date of the first visit, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, did you report to your husband the fact of this visit,
November 1, with the FBI agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't report it to him at once, but as soon as he came for
a weekend, I told him about it.</p>

<p>By the way, on that day he was due to arrive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is on November 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Lee comes off work at 5:30&mdash;comes from work at 5:30.
They left at 5 o'clock, and we told them if they wanted to they could wait and
Lee would be here soon. But they didn't want to wait.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And by "they" who do you mean? Do you recall the name of
the other man beside Agent Hosty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was only one man during the first visit. I don't
remember his name. This was probably the date because there is his name and
the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, what did you tell your husband about this visit by the
FBI agent and the interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him that they had come, that they were interested in
where he was working and where he lived, and he was, again, upset.</p>

<p>He said that he would telephone them&mdash;I don't know whether he called
or not&mdash;or that he would visit them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that all you told him at that time about the interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I told him about the content of the interview, but now I
don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember anything else that happened in the interview
that you could tell the Commission at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told you that I had told them that I didn't want them to
visit us, because we wanted to live peacefully, and that this was disturbing to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was more, but I don't remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, during this period of <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. He said that he knew that Lee had been engaged
in passing out leaflets for the Committee for Cuba, and he asked whether Lee
was doing that here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you answer that question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said that Lee does not engage in such activities here. This
was not like an interview. It was simply a conversation. We talked about even
some trifles that had no relationship to politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not your husband had any interviews
or conversations with the FBI during this period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know of two visits to the home of Ruth Paine, and I saw
them each time. But I don't know of any interviews with Lee. Lee had told
me that supposedly he had visited their office or their building. But I didn't
believe him. I thought that he was a brave rabbit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband continue to call you daily from Dallas after
he got his job?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you what he was doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Usually he would call me during the lunch break, and the
second time after he was finished work, and he told me that he was reading,
that he was watching television, and sometimes I told him that he should
not stay in his room too much, that he should go for a walk in the park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say in answer to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Or I would tell him to go out and eat, and he said that he
would listen to me. I don't know to what extent he fulfilled my requests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband come back from Dallas on November 8th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he came back on Saturday of that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I remember that there was one weekend when he didn't come
on a Friday, but said that he would come on a Saturday. And he said that
that was because he wanted to visit another place&mdash;supposedly there was
another job open, more interesting work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say where this other job was that he thought was more
interesting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that this was also based upon an ad in a newspaper,
and that it was connected&mdash;that it was related to photography. And he went
there in the morning and then&mdash;on a Saturday&mdash;and then came to us, still
during the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He came home, then, on Saturday, some time before noon of
that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, before noon.</p>

<p>It seems to me that there was a holiday on that day, on the 8th&mdash;elections&mdash;were there elections on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you thinking of November 11th, Veterans Day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I remember that day exactly. We didn't go anywhere on that
Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you and your husband buy groceries in Irving some place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not always. Sometimes we would go together with Ruth and
buy a few things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember the Hutch's Supermarket, owned by Mr.
Hutchison?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever shop there with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We never went just Lee and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did the three of you&mdash;Mrs. Paine and you and your husband go
together to shop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband try to cash checks at the Hutch's market?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He may have tried to cash checks sometimes when he received
unemployment compensation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that he tried to cash a check of $189 at this
market?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't have such a check.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As far as you know, he didn't try to cash a check of that size
at this market?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember this market. I do remember one time when
Lee wanted to cash a check, but it was $33.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that the only time that you recall he tried to cash a check?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Are you speaking of a store in Dallas or in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It is in Irving.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then I understand it. Because in Dallas I could not have
been with him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The hour of adjournment has arrived. So we will adjourn
now until tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4:30 p.m., the President's Commission adjourned.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10 a.m., on February 5, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator Richard B.
Russell, Senator John Sherman Cooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative
Gerald R. Ford, Allen W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant
counsel; Leon I. Gopadze and William D. Krimer, interpreters; John M. Thorne,
attorney for Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald; and Ruben Efron.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. We will continue with the
examination. Mr. Rankin, you may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, have you become familiar with the English language
to some extent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never studied it, but simple language I do understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We had reports that you made some study at the Southern
Methodist University. Is there anything to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How about Mr. Gregory? Did you study English with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any formal aid or teaching of English by anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had no formal instructions in it, but a Russian acquaintance,
Mr. Bouhe, wrote down some Russian phrases, and I would try to translate them
into English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, since you have been living with the Martins, I assume you
haven't had any Russian friends to try to translate English for you, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If you do not count Mr. Gopadze and the FBI interpreter, I
have not been in contact with any Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And there were considerable periods during the time you have
been living with the Martins when neither Mr. Gopadze or the FBI agent or
translator were present, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So have you been able to learn a little more English while you
have been with the Martins than you had before, because of that experience?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only a little, I think.</p>

<p>At least it is very useful for me to live with an American family who do not
speak Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That has helped you to learn some English, more than when
you were living with Mrs. Paine, who could speak Russian to you, I take it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know any French?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Other than Russian, I don't know any other language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, when you were with the Martins the Secret Service people
were there, too, were they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they helped me a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you object to the Secret Service people being there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they treat you properly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excellently&mdash;very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you object to their being around and looking out for you
as they did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did the Martins treat you during the time you have been
with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Better than I&mdash;could have been expected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you been pleased with the way they have treated you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am very pleased and I am very grateful to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, Mr. Thorne is your attorney. I understand that he told
the Civil Liberties Union people of Dallas it was all right for the Secret Service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
people to be there with you and that you liked that arrangement and did not
want to be interfered with. Was that satisfactory to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he speaking for you when he said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, because I received a letter from Mr. Olds, a leader of
that union. In that letter he said that he sympathizes with my situation, that
he supposed that the Secret Service treated me very badly and stopped me from
doing something.</p>

<p>I answered him in a letter written in Russian which was later translated into
English that all of this was not the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you feel any restraint or that you were being forced to do
anything there while you were at the Martins that was not satisfactory to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I was not forced to do anything that I did not want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anybody that tried to see you that you wanted to see during
that time or from that time up to the present&mdash;I withdraw that.</p>

<p>Was anyone who you wished to see or wanted to see you that you were willing
to see kept from seeing you at that time or up to the present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Generally some people wanted to talk to me but they couldn't
do so simply because I did not want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was that always the case, whenever you didn't talk to someone
during that period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Everything depended only on me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And whenever you did want to talk to someone or see someone,
you were always able to do that, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I did meet with Katya Ford, my former Russian friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you were always able to meet with anyone that you wanted
to, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, it has been claimed that Mrs. Ruth Paine tried to see you
at various times and was unable to do so. Can you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She is trying very hard to come to see me, but I have no desire
to meet with her. I think that she is trying to do that for herself, rather than
for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And whenever you have refused to see her when she tries to
see you, that is because you didn't want to see her yourself, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about the newspaper and television and radio people?
Have some of those tried to see you while you were at the Martins?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they have tried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And have you done anything about their efforts to see you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never wanted to be popular in such a bad sense in which I
am now, and therefore I didn't want to see them. But I did have a television
interview in which I said that I am relatively satisfied with my situation, that
I am not too worried and I thanked people for their attention towards me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe to us your relationship with your mother-in-law
now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After all of this happened I met with her at the police station.
I was, of course, very sorry for her as Lee's mother. I was always sorry for
her because Lee did not want to live with her.</p>

<p>I understood her motherly concern. But in view of the fact of everything
that happened later, her appearances in the radio, in the press, I do not think
that she is a very sound thinking woman, and I think that part of the guilt is
hers. I do not accuse her, but I think that part of the guilt in connection with
what happened with Lee lies with her because he did not perhaps receive the
education he should have during his childhood, and he did not have any correct
leadership on her part, guidance. If she were in contact with my children now,
I do not want her to cripple them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Has she tried to see you since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And have you seen her since that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Accidentally we met at the cemetery on a Sunday when I visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
there, but I didn't want to meet with her, and I left. She didn't understand
that I didn't want to meet with her and she accused the Secret Service personnel
of preventing her from seeing me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Except for the time at the jail and at the cemetery, have you
seen her since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At the time you did see your mother-in-law, did you observe any
difference in her attitude towards you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you describe that difference that you observed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At first I said that I didn't see her any more. But after Lee
was in jail I lived with her for some time at that inn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The Six Flags. And inasmuch as I lived with her and met
with her every day I could see&mdash;I was able to see the change. At least if her
relationship with me was good, it was not sincere. I think that she does not
like me. I don't think that she simply is able to like me.</p>

<p>There were some violent scenes, she didn't want to listen to anyone, there were
hysterics. Everyone was guilty of everything and no one understood her.</p>

<p>Perhaps my opinion is wrong, but at least I do not want to live with her and
to listen to scandals every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she say anything to indicate that she blamed you in connection
with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, she did not accuse me of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In your presence, at any time, did she accuse Ruth Paine of
being involved in causing the assassination or being directly involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, she never accused Ruth Paine. She simply did not like her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she tell you why she didn't like Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She told me but I didn't understand it because it was in English.
She expresses more by rather stormy mimicry, thinking that that would get
across and I would understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said that you didn't want to see Ruth Paine because you
thought she wanted to see you for her own interests. Will you tell us what
you meant by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that she wants to see me in her own selfish interests.
She likes to be well known, popular, and I think that anything that I should
write her, for example, would wind up in the press.</p>

<p>The reason that I think so is that the first time that we were in jail to see Lee,
she was with me and with her children, and she was trying to get in front of
the cameras, and to push her children and instructed her children to look this
way and look that way. And the first photographs that appeared were of me
with her children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that in the note your husband left about the
Walker incident, that there was a reference to the Red Cross, and that you
might get help there? Did you ever obtain any help from the Red Cross before
that date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know any reason why your husband put that in the note?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, because the Red Cross is an organization in all countries
which helps people who need help, and in case I needed help, since I have no
relatives here, I would be able to obtain it from this organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not your husband received any help
from the Red Cross in money payments while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In that note you remember that there was a reference to an
embassy&mdash;it didn't say which embassy. Do you know what embassy your husband
was referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had in mind the Soviet Embassy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You told about the incident of De Mohrenschildt coming to the
house and saying something about how your husband happened to miss, and
your husband looked at you and looked at him, and seemed to think that you
might have told. You have described that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Now, did you have any cause to believe at that time that De Mohrenschildt
knew anything about the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. De Mohrenschildt didn't know anything about it. Simply he
thought that this was something that Lee was likely to do. He simply made a
joke and the joke happened to hit the target.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you conclude that from what you knew about the situation
or from something that De Mohrenschildt said at some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I know this, myself. I know that Lee could not have told
him. And, otherwise, how would he have known?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. From your knowledge, were they close enough so that your husband
would have made De Mohrenschildt a confidant about anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No matter how close Lee might be to anyone, he would not have
confided such things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the money that your husband borrowed from the
Embassy in Moscow to come to this country? Do you know where he got the
money to repay that amount?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He worked and we paid out the debt. For six or seven months
we were paying off this debt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Some of the payments were rather large during that period. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And no one will believe it&mdash;it may appear strange. But
we lived very modestly. Perhaps for you it is hard to imagine how we existed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you handle the <span class="locked">finances&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course we were economizing.</p>

<p>No, Lee always handled the money, but I bought groceries. He gave me money
and I bought groceries, or more correctly, together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You would usually go to the grocery store together to buy what
you needed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then did he give you any funds separately from that, for
you to spend alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he would give it to me, but I would not take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How much were those amounts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me, I want to add something.</p>

<p>You asked me yesterday to make a list of how much we spent during a month&mdash;I
forgot. Excuse me&mdash;I will do it today.</p>

<p>For example, when we paid $60 to $65 rent per month, we would spend only
about $15 per week for groceries. As you see, I didn't die and I am not sick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you buy clothing for yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not everything. At first some of our Russian friends would
occasionally give us some clothes. But Lee would also buy clothes for me. But
in America this is no problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In my opinion life is not very expensive here. Everyone buys
according to his financial status, and no one walks around undressed. You can
buy for $20 and at a sale you might buy for $2, clothes for an entire season.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about clothing for your child? Did you handle the buying
of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Returning to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. Some of the things for children were given to us
by friends who had children. But I didn't like them and I bought some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Returning to the date of November 11, 1963, did you recall that that
was a holiday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. November 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember that it was a holiday. We did not celebrate
it. But something, I remember, was closed. Perhaps there were elections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Veterans Day in this country, and it was a Monday&mdash;refreshing
your memory in that regard.</p>

<p>Do you recall whether or not your husband went to work that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I remember that he remained at the Paine's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what he did during that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As always, he played with June and he helped me a little with
preparation of lunch, and he sat around, watched television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he doing any reading at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't read. It seems to me that on that day he was typing.
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you don't know what he was typing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me it was the <span class="locked">envelope&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Which you have identified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You remember you had a letter which mentioned Mexico and
Kostin, it was that envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is this Exhibit 16 that you are referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. You see the date is the 12th. You see, I can't remember
a specific date, but some event I can connect with it brings it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember whether your husband returned from Dallas
to Irving at any time during that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems he came on Saturday or Friday for the weekend.</p>

<p>Perhaps he didn't come. I am mixed up as to which weekends he did and
didn't come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We have a statement from a Mr. Hutchison of the supermarket
that I referred to yesterday that you and your husband were in his supermarket
on November 13. Do you recall anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If the 12th was a Monday and the 13th a Tuesday, Lee was at
work. He couldn't have been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In one of your statements that you have given the FBI and
the Secret Service you indicated that this particular weekend your husband
stayed in Dallas&mdash;that is the 15th through the 17th of November. Does that
refresh your memory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;the 15th to the 17th he remained in Dallas. That is,
he didn't come that weekend.</p>

<p>But on the 13th he was not in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That would be the weekend before the assassination, to refresh
your memory again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You see, this is why I was not surprised that he didn't come&mdash;that
he came, rather, he had not come on Friday and Saturday, and on Sunday
I called him over the telephone and this is when he had a quarrel over the
fictitious name.</p>

<p>By the way, he didn't come because I told him not to come. He had wanted
to come, he had telephoned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you tell him about not coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That he shouldn't come every week, that perhaps it is not convenient
for Ruth that the whole family be there, live there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said, "As you wish. If you don't want me to come, I won't."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you quite angry with him about the use of the fictitious
name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And when he called me over the phone a second time I
hung up and would not talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell him why you were so angry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said, "After all, when will all your foolishness come to an
end? All of these comedies. First one thing then another. And now this
fictitious name."</p>

<p>I didn't understand why. After all, it was nothing terrible if people were
to find out that he had been in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say when you said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That I didn't understand anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember an incident when he said you were a Czechoslovakian
rather than a Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. We lived on Elsbeth Street, and he had told the landlady
that I was from Czechoslovakia. But I didn't know about it, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
landlady asked me, I told her I was from Russia. I told Lee about it that
evening, and he scolded me for having said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That the landlady was very nice and she was very good to
me and she was even pleased with the fact that I was from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you object to your husband saying that you were from some
country other than Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to him about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not ashamed of the fact that I am from Russia. I can
even be proud of the fact that I am Russian. And there is no need for me to
hide it. Every person should be proud of his nationality and not be afraid or
ashamed of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say in response to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he gave the fictitious name, did he use the name Hidell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you called him that time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On the weekend, when you called him, you said there was a
fictitious name given.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what name he had given. He said that he
was under a fictitious name, but he didn't tell me which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever heard that he used the fictitious name Hidell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first learn that he used such a name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you learn that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he was interviewed by some anti-Cubans, he used
this name and spoke of an organization. I knew there was no such organization.
And I know that Hidell is merely an altered Fidel, and I laughed
at such foolishness. My imagination didn't work that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to him about it at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said that it wasn't a nice thing to do and some day it would
be discovered anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the weekend of November 15th to 17th, which was the
weekend before the assassination, do you know what your husband did or
how he spent that weekend while he was in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he took the rifle before he went into
Dallas, that trip, for that weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. I think that he took the rifle on Thursday
when he came the next time, but I didn't see him take it. I assume that.
I cannot know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Except for the time in New Orleans that you described, and
the time you called to Dallas to ask for your husband, do you know of any
other time your husband was using an assumed name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, no more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think he was using that assumed name in connection
with this Fair Play for Cuba activity or something else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The name Hidell, which you pronounced Hidell, was in connection
with his activity with the non-existing organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you and your husband live under the name Hidell in
New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You were never identified as the Hidells, as far as you
knew, while you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. No one knew that Lee was Hidell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you discover it, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I already said that when I listened to the radio, they spoke
of that name, and I asked him who, and he said that it was he.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that after the arrest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember when the interview took place, before
the arrest or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But it was in regard to some interview for radio transmission,
and he had identified himself as Hidell, rather than Oswald, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;he represented himself as Oswald, but he said that
the organization which he supposedly represents is headed by Hidell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He was using the name Hidell, then, to have a fictitious president
or head of the organization which really was he himself, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have told us about his practicing with the rifle, the telescopic
lens, on the back porch at New Orleans, and also his using the bolt
action that you heard from time to time.</p>

<p>Will you describe that a little more fully to us, as best you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I cannot describe that in greater detail. I can only say
that Lee would sit there with the rifle and open and close the bolt and
clean it. No, he didn't clean it at that time.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;twice he did clean it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he seem to be practicing with the telescopic lens,
too, and sighting the gun on different objects?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. The rifle was always with this. I don't know
exactly how he practiced, because I was in the house, I was busy. I just knew
that he sits there with his rifle. I was not interested in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this during the light of the day or during the darkness?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During darkness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it so dark that neighbors could not see him on the
porch there with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, during the week of the assassination, did your husband
call you at all by telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He telephoned me on Monday, after I had called him on
Sunday, and he was not there.</p>

<p>Or, rather, he was there, but he wasn't called to the phone because he
was known by another name.</p>

<p>On Monday he called several times, but after I hung up on him and didn't
want to talk to him he did not call again. He then arrived on Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you he was coming Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn that he was using the assumed name of Lee as his
last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know it now, but I did not ever know it before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thursday was the 21st. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the assassination was on the 22d.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is very hard to forget.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband give any reason for coming home on Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he was lonely because he hadn't come the preceding
weekend, and he wanted to make his peace with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He tried to talk to me but I would not answer him, and he was
very upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you upset with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was angry, of course. He was not angry&mdash;he was upset. I
was angry. He tried very hard to please me. He spent quite a bit of time
putting away diapers and played with the children on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you indicate to him that you were angry with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By not talking to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And how did he show that he was upset?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was upset over the fact that I would not answer him. He
tried to start a conversation with me several times, but I would not answer.
And he said that he didn't want me to be angry at him because this upsets him.</p>

<p>On that day, he suggested that we rent an apartment in Dallas. He said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason for my being so angry was
the fact that we were not living together. That if I want to he would rent an
apartment in Dallas tomorrow&mdash;that he didn't want me to remain with Ruth
any longer, but wanted me to live with him in Dallas.</p>

<p>He repeated this not once but several times, but I refused. And he said that
once again I was preferring my friends to him, and that I didn't need him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said it would be better if I remained with Ruth until the
holidays, he would come, and we would all meet together. That this was better
because while he was living alone and I stayed with Ruth, we were spending
less money. And I told him to buy me a washing machine, because two children
it became too difficult to wash by hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said he would buy me a washing machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you. That it would be better if he bought something
for himself&mdash;that I would manage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did this seem to make him more upset, when you suggested that
he wait about getting an apartment for you to live in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He then stopped talking and sat down and watched television
and then went to bed. I went to bed later. It was about 9 o'clock when he
went to sleep. I went to sleep about 11:30. But it seemed to me that he was
not really asleep. But I didn't talk to him.</p>

<p>In the morning he got up, said goodbye, and left, and that I shouldn't get up&mdash;as
always, I did not get up to prepare breakfast. This was quite usual.</p>

<p>And then after I fed Rachel, I took a look to see whether Lee was here, but
he had already gone. This was already after the police had come. Ruth told
me that in the evening she had worked in the garage and she knows that she
had put out the light but that the light was on later&mdash;that the light was on in
the morning. And she guessed that Lee was in the garage.</p>

<p>But I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she tell you when she thought your husband had been in the
garage, what time of the day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She thought that it was during the evening, because the light
remained on until morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why did you stay awake until 11:30? Were you still angry
with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not for that reason, but because I had to wash dishes and
be otherwise busy with the household&mdash;take a bath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is a good place for a recess, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right. We can take a recess now.</p>

<p>We will recess now for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, why did the use of this false name by your husband
make you so angry? Would you explain that a little bit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It would be unpleasant and incomprehensible to any wife if her
husband used a fictitious name. And then, of course, I thought that if he would
see that I don't like it and that I explained to him that this is not the smart
thing to do, that he would stop doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you feel that you were becoming more impatient with all of
these things that your husband was doing, the Fair Play for Cuba and the
Walker incident, and then this fictitious name business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course. I was tired of it.</p>

<p>Every day I was waiting for some kind of a new surprise. I couldn't wait to
find out what else would he think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss that with your husband at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said that no one needed anything like that, that for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
reason at all he was thinking that he was not like other people, that he was
more important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He would seem to agree, but then would continue again in two
or three days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you sense that he was not intending to carry out his
agreement with you to not have another Walker incident or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I generally didn't think that Lee would repeat anything like
that. Generally, I knew that the rifle was very tempting for him. But I didn't
believe that he would repeat it. It was hard to believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I wasn't clear about when Mrs. Paine thought that your husband
might have been in the garage and had the light on. Can you give us any help
on the time of day that she had in mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the morning she thought about it. But she didn't attach
any significance to it at that time. It was only after the police had come
that this became more significant for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So she thought it was in the morning after he got up from his
night's rest that he might have gone to the garage, turned on the light?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In my opinion, she thought that it was at night, or during the
evening that he had been in the garage and turned on the light. At least that
is what she said to me. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she indicate whether she thought it was before he went to
bed at 9 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. At first it seems it wasn't nine, it was perhaps
ten o'clock when Lee went to bed. And first, Ruth went to her room and then
Lee went. He was there after her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So he might have been in the garage sometime between 9 and
10? Was that what you thought?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. But I think that he might have even been there in the
morning and turned on the light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On this evening when you were angry with him, had he come
home with the young Mr. Frazier that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was the last time that you had noticed the rifle before
that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said that I saw&mdash;for the first and last time I saw the rifle
about a week after I had come to Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>But, as I said, the rifle was wrapped in a blanket, and I was sure when the
police had come that the rifle was still in the blanket, because it was all rolled
together. And, therefore, when they took the blanket and the rifle was not
in it, I was very much surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see the rifle in a paper cover?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you describe for the Commission the place in the garage
where the rifle was located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When you enter the garage from the street it was in the
front part, the left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By the left you mean left of the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is an overhead door and the rifle was to the left, on the
floor.</p>

<p>It was always in the same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anything else close to the rifle that you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Next to it there were some&mdash;next to the rifle there were some
suitcases and Ruth had some paper barrels in the garage where the kids used
to play.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The way the rifle was wrapped with a blanket, could you
tell whether or not the rifle had been removed and the blanket just left there
at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It always had the appearance of having something inside of
it. But I only looked at it really once, and I was always sure the rifle was
in it. Therefore, it is very hard to determine when the rifle was taken. I only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
assumed that it was on Thursday, because Lee had arrived so unexpectedly
for some reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you believe that the reason for his coming out to see you
Thursday was to make up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think there were two reasons. One was to make up with
me, and the other to take the rifle. This is&mdash;this, of course, is not irreconcilable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you think he came to take the rifle because of what you
learned since. Is that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before this incident about the fictitious name, were you and
your husband getting along quite well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he seem to like his job at the depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, because it was not dirty work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had he talked about getting any other job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. When he went to answer some ads, he preferred to get
some work connected with photography rather than this work. He liked this
work relatively speaking&mdash;he liked it. But, of course, he wanted to get something
better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you like the photographic work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. It was interesting for him. When he would see his work
in the newspaper he would always point it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He had a reference in his notebook to the word "Microdot".
Do you know what he meant by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did your husband get along with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was polite to her, as an acquaintance would be, but he
didn't like her. He told me that he detested her&mdash;a tall and stupid woman.
She is, of course, not too smart, but most people aren't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say anything to indicate he thought Mrs. Paine was
coming between him and you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine say anything about your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She didn't say anything bad. I don't know what she thought.
But she didn't say anything bad.</p>

<p>Perhaps she didn't like something about him, but she didn't tell me. She
didn't want to hurt me by saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I have understood from your testimony that you did not really
care to go to Russia but your husband was the one that was urging that, and
that is why you requested the visa, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And later he talked about not only you and your child going,
but also his going with you, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what caused him to make that change?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At one time&mdash;I don't remember whether he was working at that
time or not&mdash;he was very sad and upset. He was sitting and writing something
in his notebook. I asked him what he was writing and he said, "It would be
better if I go with you."</p>

<p>Then he went into the kitchen and he sat there in the dark, and when I came
in I saw that he was crying. I didn't know why. But, of course, when a man
is crying it is not a very pleasant thing, and I didn't start to question him about
why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say to you that he didn't want you to leave him alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you at that time say anything to him about your all staying
in this country and getting along together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him, of course, that it would be better for us to stay here.
But if it was very difficult for him and if he was always worried about tomorrow,
then perhaps it would be better if we went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On the evening of the 21st, was anything said about curtain
rods or his taking curtain rods to town the following day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I didn't have any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He didn't say anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss the weekend that was coming up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he probably would not come on Friday, and he
didn't come&mdash;he was in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did the quarrel that you had at that time seem to cause him to
be more disturbed than usual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not particularly. At least he didn't talk about that quarrel
when he came. Usually he would remember about what happened. This time
he didn't blame me for anything, didn't ask me any questions, just wanted to
make up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I understood that when you didn't make up he was quite disturbed
and you were still angry, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I wasn't really very angry. I, of course, wanted to make up with
him. But I gave the appearance of being very angry. I was smiling inside,
but I had a serious expression on my face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And as a result of that, did he seem to be more disturbed than
usual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As always, as usual. Perhaps a little more. At least when
he went to bed he was very upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you think that had anything to do with the assassination the
next day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps he was thinking about all of that. I don't think that
he was asleep. Because, in the morning when the alarm clock went off he hadn't
woken up as usual before the alarm went off, and I thought that he probably had
fallen asleep very late. At least then I didn't think about it. Now I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he said he would not be home that Friday evening, did
you ask him why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that since he was home on Thursday, that it wouldn't
make any sense to come again on Friday, that he would come for the weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did that cause you to think that he had any special plans to do
anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you usually keep a wallet with money in it at the Paines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, in my room at Ruth Paine's there was a black wallet in a
wardrobe. Whenever Lee would come he would put money in there, but I never
counted it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On the evening of November 21st, do you know how much was
in the wallet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. One detail that I remember was that he had asked me
whether I had bought some shoes for myself, and I said no, that I hadn't had
any time. He asked me whether June needed anything and told me to buy
everything that I needed for myself and for June&mdash;and for the children.</p>

<p>This was rather unusual for him, that he would mention that first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he take the money from the wallet from time to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he generally kept the amount that he needed and put the
rest in the wallet.</p>

<p>I know that the money that was found there, that you think this was not
Lee's money. But I know for sure that this was money that he had earned.
He had some money left after his trip to Mexico. Then we received an unemployment
compensation check for $33. And then Lee paid only $7 or $8 for his
room. And I know how he eats, very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what his ordinary lunch was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Peanut butter sandwich, cheese sandwich, some lettuce, and
he would buy himself a hamburger, something else, a coke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what about his evening meal? Do you know what he ate
in the evening meal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Usually meat, vegetables, fruit, dessert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where would he have that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He loved bananas. They were inexpensive.</p>

<p>The place where he rented a room, he could not cook there. He said that
there was some sort of a cafe across the street and that he ate there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever tell you what he paid for his evening meal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About a dollar, $1.30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about his breakfast? Do you know what he had for breakfast
ordinarily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He never had breakfast. He just drank coffee and that is all.</p>

<p>Not because he was trying to economize. Simply he never liked to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, will you note the presence of Mr. Ruben Efron
in the hearing room. He also knows Russian.</p>

<p>On November 21, the day before the assassination that you were describing,
was there any discussion between you and your husband about President
Kennedy's trip or proposed trip to Texas, Dallas and the Fort Worth area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I asked Lee whether he knew where the President would speak,
and told him that I would very much like to hear him and to see him. I asked
him how this could be done.</p>

<p>But he said he didn't know how to do that, and didn't enlarge any further
on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had there ever <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was also somewhat unusual&mdash;his lack of desire to talk
about that subject any further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you explain that to us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think about it more now.</p>

<p>At that time, I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you think it was unusual? Could you explain that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The fact that he didn't talk a lot about it. He merely gave
me&mdash;said something as an answer, and did not have any further comments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you mean by that usually he would discuss a matter of that
kind and show considerable interest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course, he would have told who would be there and
where this would take place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything about his showing a lack of interest at
that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I merely shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, prior to that time, had there been any discussion between
you concerning the proposed trip of President Kennedy to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While you were in New Orleans, was there any discussion or
reference to President Kennedy's proposed trip to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband make any comments about President Kennedy
on that evening, of the 21st?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had your husband at any time that you can recall said anything
against President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember any&mdash;ever having said that. I don't know.
He never told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say anything good about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Usually he would translate magazine articles. They were
generally good. And he did not say that this contradicted his opinion. I just
remembered that he talked about Kennedy's father, who made his fortune by a
not very&mdash;in a not very good manner. Disposing of such funds, of course, it
was easier for his sons to obtain an education and to obtain a government position,
and it was easier to make a name for themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about President Kennedy's father making his
fortune?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he had speculated in wine. I don't know to what
extent that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he read these articles to you, did he comment favorably
upon President Kennedy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have already said that he would translate articles which
were good, but he would not comment on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you <span class="locked">recall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. At least when I found out that Lee had shot at
the President, for me this was surprising. And I didn't believe it. I didn't
believe for a long time that Lee had done that. That he had wanted to kill
Kennedy&mdash;because perhaps Walker was there again, perhaps he wanted to kill
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why did you not believe this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because I had never heard anything bad about Kennedy from
Lee. And he never had anything against him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you also say that he never said anything about him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He read articles which were favorable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say he approved of those articles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he didn't say anything. Perhaps he did reach his own
conclusions reading these articles, but he didn't tell me about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So apparently he didn't indicate any approval or disapproval as
far as he was concerned, of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is correct. The President is the President. In my
opinion, he never wanted to overthrow him. At least he never showed me that.
He never indicated that he didn't want that President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you observe that his acts on November 21st the evening
before the assassination, were anything like they were the evening before the
Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Absolutely nothing in common.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything at all that would indicate he was contemplating
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he discuss the television programs he saw that evening with
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was looking at TV by himself. I was busy in the kitchen.
At one time when we were&mdash;when I was together with him they showed some
sort of war films, from World War II. And he watched them with interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall films that he saw called "Suddenly," and "We
were Strangers" that involved assassinations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember the names of these films. If you would remind
me of the contents, perhaps I would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, "Suddenly," was about the assassination of a president,
and the other was about the assassination of a Cuban dictator.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Lee saw those films.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you that he had seen them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was with him when he watched them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall about when this was with reference to the date
of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems that this was before Rachel's birth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Weeks or months? Can you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Several days. Some five days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss the films after you had seen them with your
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One film about the assassination of the president in Cuba,
which I had seen together with him, he said that this was a fictitious situation,
but that the content of the film was similar to the actual situation which existed
in Cuba, meaning the revolution in Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did either of you comment on either film being like the attempt
on Walker's life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I didn't watch the other film.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anything said by your husband about how easy an assassination
could be committed like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I only know that he watched the film with interest, but I
didn't like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall anything else he said about either of these films?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing else. He didn't tell me anything else. He talked to
Ruth a few words. Perhaps she knows more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By Ruth, you mean Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They spoke in English.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did Mrs. Paine tell you what he said to her at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall your husband saying at any time after he saw
the film about the Cuban assassination that this was the old-fashioned way of
assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall anything being said by your husband at any time
about Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, while we were still in Russia, and Connally at that time
was Secretary of the Navy, Lee wrote him a letter in which he asked Connally
to help him obtain a good character reference because at the end of his Army
service he had a good characteristic&mdash;honorable discharge&mdash;but that it had been
changed after it became known he had gone to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had it been changed to undesirable discharge, as you understand
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Then we received a letter from Connally in which he said
that he had turned the matter over to the responsible authorities. That was
all in Russia.</p>

<p>But here it seems he had written again to that organization with a request to
review. But he said from time to time that these are bureaucrats, and he was
dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know when he wrote again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that letter written from New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. I only know about the fact, but when and how,
I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband say anything to you to indicate he had a dislike
for Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Here he didn't say anything.</p>

<p>But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. It seems to me that Connally
was running for Governor and Lee said that when he would return to the
United States he would vote for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is all that you remember that he said about Governor
Connally then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. With regard to the Walker incident, you said that your husband
seemed disturbed for several weeks. Did you notice anything of that kind
with regard to the day prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On November 22, the day of the assassination, you said your
husband got up and got his breakfast. Did you get up at all before he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I woke up before him, and I then went to the kitchen
to see whether he had had breakfast or not&mdash;whether he had already left for
work. But the coffee pot was cold and Lee was not there.</p>

<p>And when I met Ruth that morning, I asked her whether Lee had had coffee
or not, and she said probably, perhaps he had made himself some instant
coffee.</p>

<p>But probably he hadn't had any breakfast that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then did he say anything to you that morning at all, or did
he get up and go without speaking to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me to take as much money as I needed and to buy
everything, and said goodbye, and that is all.</p>

<p>After the police had already come, I noticed that Lee had left his wedding ring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You didn't observe that that morning when your husband had
left, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know approximately what time your husband left that
morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have written it there, but I have now forgotten whether
it was seven or eight. But a quarter to eight&mdash;I don't know. I have now
forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What time was he due for work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was due at work at 8 or 8:30. At 7:15 he was already
gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he rode with Wesley Frazier that
morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. I didn't hear him leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see a paper bag or cover for the rifle at the Paine's
residence or garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see a bag at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did your husband have his lunch? Did he take a sandwich
to the depository, or did he go home to his rooming house for lunch?
Do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He usually took sandwiches to lunch. But I don't know
whether he would go home or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had your husband ever left his wedding ring at home that
way before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At one time while he was still at Fort Worth, it was inconvenient
for him to work with his wedding ring on and he would remove it,
but at work&mdash;he would not leave it at home. His wedding ring was rather
wide, and it bothered him.</p>

<p>I don't know now. He would take it off at work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then this is the first time during your married life that he
had ever left it at home where you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether your husband carried any package with
him when he left the house on November 22nd?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that he had a package with his lunch. But a small
package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he had any package like a rifle in some
container?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do the rest of the morning, after you got up on
November 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When I got up the television set was on, and I knew that
Kennedy was coming. Ruth had gone to the doctor with her children and
she left the television set on for me. And I watched television all morning,
even without having dressed. She was running around in her pajamas and
watching television with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before the assassination, did you ever see your husband examining
the route of the parade as it was published in the paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see him looking at a map of Dallas like he did
in connection with the Walker shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you learn of the shooting of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was watching television, and Ruth by that time was already
with me, and she said someone had shot at the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was hard for me to say anything. We both turned pale.
I went to my room and cried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think immediately that your husband might have been
involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine say anything about the possibility of your husband
being involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, but she only said that "By the way, they fired from the
building in which Lee is working."</p>

<p>My heart dropped. I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle
was there, and I saw that the blanket was still there, and I said, "Thank
God." I thought, "Can there really be such a stupid man in the world that
could do something like that?" But I was already rather upset at that time&mdash;I
don't know why. Perhaps my intuition.</p>

<p>I didn't know what I was doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you look in the blanket to see if the rifle was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't unroll the blanket. It was in its usual position, and
it appeared to have something inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you at any time open the blanket to see if the rifle was
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, only once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have told us about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what about Mrs. Paine? Did she look in the blanket to
see if the rifle was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She didn't know about the rifle.</p>

<p>Perhaps she did know. But she never told me about it.</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you learn that the rifle was not in the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When the police arrived and asked whether my husband had a
rifle, and I said "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They began to search the apartment. When they came to the
garage and took the blanket, I thought, "Well, now, they will find it."</p>

<p>They opened the blanket but there was no rifle there.</p>

<p>Then, of course, I already knew that it was Lee. Because, before that, while
I thought that the rifle was at home, I did not think that Lee had done that.
I thought the police had simply come because he was always under suspicion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by that&mdash;he was always under suspicion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, the FBI would visit us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they indicate what they suspected him of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They didn't tell me anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to the police when they came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember now. I was so upset that I don't remember
what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell them about your husband leaving his wedding ring
that morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, because I didn't know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell them that you had looked for the gun you thought
was in the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, it seems to me I didn't say that. They didn't ask me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you watch the police open the blanket to see if the rifle was
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine also watch them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me, as far as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When the police came, did Mrs. Paine act as an interpreter for
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. She told me about what they had said. But I was not
being questioned so that she would interpret. She told me herself. She very
much loved to talk and she welcomed the occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean by that that she answered questions of the police and
then told you what she had said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what did she tell you that she had said to the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She talked to them in the usual manner, in English, when they
were addressing her.</p>

<p>But when they addressed me, she was interpreting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the exact time of the day that you discovered the
wedding ring there at the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About 2 o'clock, I think. I don't remember. Then everything
got mixed up, all time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did the police spend considerable time there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember the names of any of the officers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did they treat you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Rather gruff, not very polite. They kept on following me.
I wanted to change clothes because I was dressed in a manner fitting to the
house. And they would not even let me go into the dressing room to change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, what could I tell them?</p>

<p>I asked them, but they didn't want to. They were rather rough. They kept
on saying, hurry up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they want you to go with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you leave the house with them right soon after they came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About an hour, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what were they doing during that hour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They searched the entire house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they take anything with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;everything, even some tapes&mdash;Ruth's tapes from a tape
recorder, her things. I don't know what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they take many of your belongings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't watch at that time. After all, it is not my business. If
they need it, let them take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they give you an inventory of what they took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have never received an inventory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you now know what they took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I know that I am missing my documents, that I am missing
Lee's documents, Lee's wedding ring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about clothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Robert had some of Lee's clothing. I don't know what was
left of Lee's things, but I hope they will return it. No one needs it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What documents do you refer to that you are missing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My foreign passport, my immigration card, my birth certificate,
my wedding certificate&mdash;marriage certificate, June's and Rachel's birth certificates.
Then various letters, my letters from friends. Perhaps something that
has some bearing&mdash;photographs, whatever has some reference&mdash;whatever refers
to the business at hand, let it remain.</p>

<p>Then my diploma. I don't remember everything now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What documents of your husband's do you recall that they took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't see what they took. At least at the present time I
have none of Lee's documents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The documents of his that you refer to that you don't have are
similar to your own that you described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He also had a passport, several work books, labor cards.
I don't know what men here&mdash;what sort of documents men here carry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, it is now 12:30.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think we will recess now for lunch.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the Commission recessed.)</p>

<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. Mr. Rankin, you may
continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, we will hand you Exhibit 19, which purports to
be an envelope from the Soviet Embassy at Washington, dated November 4,
1963, and ask you if you recall seeing the original or a copy of that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had not seen this envelope before, but Lee had told me that
a letter had been received in my name from the Soviet Embassy with congratulations
on the October Revolution&mdash;on the date of the October Revolution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you think that that came in that Exhibit 19, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, because the date coincides, and I didn't get any other
letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 19.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be in the record and given the next number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 19, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In some newspaper accounts your mother-in-law has intimated
that your husband might have been an agent for some government, and that
she might have&mdash;did have information in that regard.</p>

<p>Do you know anything about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first time that I hear anything about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is all untrue, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever know that you husband was at any time an
agent of the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever know that your husband was an agent of the
Cuban government at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever know that your husband was an agent of any
agency of the United States Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever know that your husband was an agent of any
government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have any idea of the motive which induced your husband
to kill the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From everything that I know about my husband, and of the
events that transpired, I can conclude that he wanted in any way, whether
good or bad, to do something that would make him outstanding, that he would
be known in history.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And is it then your belief that he assassinated the President,
for this purpose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is my opinion. I don't know how true that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what about his shooting at General Walker? Do you
think he had the same motive or purpose in doing that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After the assassination, were you coerced or abused in any
way by the police or anyone else in connection with the inquiry about the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you see or speak to your husband on November 22d, following
his arrest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the 22d I did not see him.</p>

<p>On the 23d I met with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when you met with him on the 23d, was it at your request
or his?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know whether he requested it, but I know that I
wanted to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you request the right to see your husband on the 22d,
after his arrest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what answer were you given at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was not permitted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who gave you that answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. The police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know what officer of the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you spend the evening on the night of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the day of the assassination, on the 22d, after returning
from questioning by the police, I spent the night with Mrs. Paine, together with
Lee's mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you receive any threats from anyone at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did any law enforcement agency offer you protection at that
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you saw your husband on November 23d, the day after
the assassination, did you have a conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where did this occur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were just the two of you together at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, the mother was there together with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At that time what did you say to him and what did he say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You probably know better than I do what I told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, I need your best recollection, if you can give it to us,
Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course he tried to console me that I should not worry, that
everything would turn out well. He asked about how the children were. He
spoke of some friends who supposedly would help him. I don't know who
he had in mind. That he had written to someone in New York before that.
I was so upset that of course I didn't understand anything of that. It was
simply talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told him that the police had been there and that a search
had been conducted, that they had asked me whether we had a rifle, and I had
answered yes.</p>

<p>And he said that if there would be a trial, and that if I am questioned it
would be my right to answer or to refuse to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gopadze</span>. She asked me if she talked about that thing, the first evening
when I talked to her with the FBI agents, she asked me if she didn't have to
tell me if she didn't want to. And warning her of her constitutional rights,
telling her she didn't have to tell me anything she didn't want to&mdash;at that
time, she told me she knew about that, that she didn't have to tell me if she
didn't want to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And he then asked me, "Who told you you had that right?"
And then I understood that he knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gopadze</span>. At that time I did not know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I thought you had been told about it because the conversation
had certainly been written down. I am sure that while I was talking to Lee&mdash;after
all, this was not some sort of a trial of a theft, but a rather important
matter, and I am sure that everything was recorded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Let me see if I can clarify what you were saying.</p>

<p>As I understand it, Mr. Gopadze had talked to you with the FBI agents after
the assassination, and they had cautioned you that you didn't have to talk, in
accordance with your constitutional rights, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you told Mr. Gopadze you already knew that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember what I told him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gopadze</span>. Mrs. Oswald, on her own accord, asked me, or told me that
she didn't have to tell us anything she didn't want to.</p>

<p>I said, "That is right."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I disliked him immediately, because he introduced himself as
being from the FBI. I was at that time very angry at the FBI because I thought
perhaps Lee is not guilty, and they have merely tricked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gopadze</span>. Mr. Rankin, may I, for the benefit of the Commission&mdash;I would
like to mention that I didn't represent myself as being an FBI agent. I just
said that I was a government agent, with the FBI. And I introduced both
agents to Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And, Mrs. Oswald, you thought he was connected with the FBI
in some way, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had come with them, and I decided he must have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And your ill feeling towards the FBI <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He did not tell me that he was with the FBI, but he was with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Your ill feeling towards the FBI was due to the fact that you
thought they were trying to obtain evidence to show your husband was guilty
in regard to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you have said since the assassination that you didn't
want to believe it, but you had to believe that your husband had killed President
Kennedy, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. There were some facts, but not too many, and I didn't
know too much about it at that time yet. After all, there are in life some
accidental concurrences of circumstances. And it is very difficult to believe
in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But from what you have learned since that time, you arrived
at this conclusion, did you, that your husband had killed the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Unfortunately, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you related those facts that you learned to what you already
knew about your life with him and what you knew he had done and appeared
to be doing in order to come to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you saw your husband on November 23d, at the police
station, did you ask him if he had killed President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him at that time if he had killed Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I said, "I don't believe that you did that, and everything
will turn out well."</p>

<p>After all, I couldn't accuse him&mdash;after all, he was my husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that I should not worry, that everything would turn
out well. But I could see by his eyes that he was guilty. Rather, he tried to
appear to be brave. However, by his eyes I could tell that he was afraid.</p>

<p>This was just a feeling. It is hard to describe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you help us a little bit by telling us what you saw in
his eyes that caused you to think that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said goodbye to me with his eyes. I knew that. He said
that everything would turn out well, but he did not believe it himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How could you tell that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I saw it in his eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband ever at any time say to you that he was
responsible or had anything to do with the killing of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After Kennedy&mdash;I only saw him once, and he didn't tell me
anything, and I didn't see him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he at any time tell you that he had anything to do
with the shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever ask your husband why he ran away or tried to
escape after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't ask him about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On either November 22d, or Saturday, November 23d, did anyone
contact you and advise you that your husband was going to be shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you spend the evening of November 23d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After seeing Lee, we went with some reporters of Life Magazine
who had rented a room, but it turned out to be&mdash;in a hotel&mdash;but it turned
out to be inconvenient because there were many people there and we went to
another place. We were in a hotel in Dallas, but I don't know the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was with you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;June and Rachel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was Robert with you at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I saw Robert in the police&mdash;at the police station, but he did
not stay with us at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the evening of November 22d, were you at Ruth Paine's
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At that time did the reporters come there and the Life reporters,
and ask you and your mother-in-law and Mrs. Paine about what had
happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We have a report that there was quite a scene between Mrs.
Paine and your mother-in-law at that time. Was there such an event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not understand English too well, and I did not know
what they were quarreling about. I know that the reporters wanted to talk to
me, but his mother made a scene and went into hysterics, and said I should not
talk and that she would not talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she say why she would not talk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps she said it in English. I didn't understand. She
talked to the reporters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she say anything about being paid if she was going to tell
any story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She has a mania&mdash;only money, money, money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand that she was quarreling with Ruth Paine
about something concerning the interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. It appeared to be a quarrel, but what they quarreled
about, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And after the quarrel, did you leave there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I went to my room. But then I showed Lee's mother the
photograph, where he is photographed with a rifle, and told her he had shot at
Walker and it appeared he might have been shooting at the President. She
said that I should hide that photograph and not show it to anyone.</p>

<p>On the next day I destroyed one photograph which I had. I think I had
two small ones. When we were in the hotel I burned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to her about the destruction of the photographs
when she suggested that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She saw it, while I was destroying them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After the assassination, did the police and FBI and the Secret
Service ask you many questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the police station there was a routine regular questioning,
as always happens. And then after I was with the agents of the Secret Service
and the FBI, they asked me many questions, of course&mdash;many questions. Sometimes
the FBI agents asked me questions which had no bearing or relationship,
and if I didn't want to answer they told me that if I wanted to live in this
country, I would have to help in this matter, even though they were often
irrelevant. That is the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know who said that to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Heitman and Bogoslav, who was an interpreter for the
FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You understand that you do not have to tell this Commission
in order to stay in this country, don't you, now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are not under any compulsion to tell the Commission here
in order to be able to stay in the country.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you have come here because you want to tell us what you
could about this matter, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is my voluntary wish, and no one forced me to do this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did these various people from the police and the Secret Service
and the FBI treat you courteously when they asked you about the matters that
they did, concerning the assassination and things leading up to it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have a very good opinion about the Secret Service, and the
people in the police department treated me very well. But the FBI agents were
somehow polite and gruff. Sometimes they would mask a gruff question in a
polite form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you see anyone from the Immigration Service during this
period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know who that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember the name. I think he is the chairman of
that office. At least he was a representative of that office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By "that office" you mean the one at Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was told that he had especially come from New York, it
seems to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That if I was not guilty of anything, if I had not committed
any crime against this Government, then I had every right to live in this country.
This was a type of introduction before the questioning by the FBI. He
even said that it would be better for me if I were to help them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he explain to you what he meant by being better for you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the sense that I would have more rights in this country.
I understood it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand that you were being threatened with deportation
if you didn't answer these questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I did not understand it that way.</p>

<p>You see, it was presented in such a delicate form, but there was a clear
implication that it would be better if I were to help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was only felt. It wasn't said in actual words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you feel that it was a threat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was not quite a threat&mdash;it was not a threat. But it was
their great desire that I be in contact, in touch with the FBI. I sensed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you did not consider it to be a threat to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anyone indicate that it would affect your ability to work
in this country if you cooperated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Excuse me. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything else about your treatment by law enforcement
officials during this period that you would like to tell the Commission
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that the FBI agents knew that I was afraid that after
everything that had happened I could not remain to live in this country, and
they somewhat exploited that for their own purposes, in a very polite form, so
that you could not say anything after that. They cannot be accused of anything.
They approached it in a very clever, contrived way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anyone else of the law enforcement officials that you
felt treated you in that manner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. As for the rest, I was quite content. Everyone was very
attentive towards me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where were you on the morning of November 24th when your
husband was killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The night from the 23d to the 24th I spent at a hotel in Dallas,
together with the mother. She wanted to make sure that the Life reporters
who had taken this room would pay for it, as they had promised. But they
disappeared. Then she telephoned Robert, it seems to me, and Gregory&mdash;no,
Mr. Gregory. And I know that he came with Robert, and Robert paid for the
room. And, after that, after we left the hotel, we met with the Secret Service
agents. I wanted to see Lee, and we were supposed to go to the police station
to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was on November 24th, on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember whether we went to Ruth to take my things
or perhaps&mdash;in general, I remember that en route, in the car, Mike Howard
or Charley Kunkel said that Lee had been shot today.</p>

<p>At first he said that it wasn't serious&mdash;perhaps just not to frighten me. I
was told that he had been taken to a hospital, and then I was told that he had
been seriously wounded.</p>

<p>Then they had to telephone somewhere. They stopped at the house of the
chief of police, Curry. From there, I telephone Ruth to tell her that I wanted
to take several things which I needed with me and asked her to prepare them.
And that there was a wallet with money and Lee's ring.</p>

<p>Soon after that&mdash;Robert was no longer with me, but Gregory was there, and
the mother, and the Secret Service agents. They said that Lee had died.</p>

<p>After that, we went to the Motel Inn, the Six Flags Inn, where I stayed for
several days&mdash;perhaps two weeks&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what time of the day you heard that your husband
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two o'clock in the afternoon, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where were you at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was in a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Just riding around, or at some particular place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not at two o'clock&mdash;earlier. Lee was shot at 11 o'clock.
It was probably close to 12 o'clock. He died at one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where was the car that you were in at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were on the way to Chief Curry, en route from the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do after you went to the motel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I left with Robert and we prepared for the funeral.</p>

<p>Then Ruth Paine sent my things to me via the agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gopadze</span>. She would like a recess for a little while. She has a headache.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, we will recess.</p>

<p>(Brief recess)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. Do you feel refreshed now,
Mrs. Oswald, ready to proceed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I asked you if you asked your husband about his
efforts to escape, why he did that. I will ask you now whether in light of what
you said about his seeking notoriety in connection with the assassination, in
your opinion how you explain his efforts to escape, which would presumably
not give him that notoriety.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he did that, he probably did it with the intention of becoming
notorious. But after that, it is probably a normal reaction of a man to
try and escape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You will recall that in the interviews, after the assassination,
you first said that you thought your husband didn't do it, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember it, but quite possibly I did say that.</p>

<p>You must understand that now I only speak the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Recently you said that you thought your husband did kill
President Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I now have enough facts to say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you give us or the Commission an idea generally about
when you came to this latter conclusion, that he did kill President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps a week after it all happened, perhaps a little more.
The more facts came out, the more convinced I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have stated in some of your interviews that your husband
would get on his knees and cry and say that he was lost. Do you recall when
this happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it more than one occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he said that, that was only once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And do you know what caused him to say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know whether there was some occasion or some
happening that caused it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your mother-in-law ever indicate that she had some particular
evidence, either oral or documentary, that would decide this case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, she always said that she has a pile of papers and many
acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever ask her to tell you what it was that would be so
decisive about the case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would have liked to ask her, but I didn't speak any English.
And then I didn't believe her. What documents could she have when she had
not seen Lee for one year, and she didn't even know we lived in New Orleans?</p>

<p>I think that is just simply idle talk, that she didn't have anything.</p>

<p>Perhaps she does have something.</p>

<p>But I think that it is only she who considers that she has something that
might reveal, uncover this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Has there been any time that you wanted to see your mother-in-law
that you have been prevented from doing so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Never.</p>

<p>I don't want to see her, I didn't want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I am going to ask you about differences between
you and your mother-in-law, not for the purpose of embarrassing you in any
way, but since we are going to ask her to testify it might be helpful to the Commission
to know that background.</p>

<p>I hope you will bear with us.</p>

<p>Have you had some differences with your mother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry that you will devote your time to questioning her,
because you will only be tired and very sick after talking to her. I am very
much ashamed to have this kind of relationship to my mother-in-law. I would
like to be closer to her and to be on better terms with her. But when you get
to know her, you will understand why. I don't think that she can help you.</p>

<p>But if it is a formality, then, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, can you describe for the Commission your differences
so the Commission will be able to evaluate those differences?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, she asserts, for example, that I don't know anything,
that I am being forced to say that Lee is guilty in everything, that she knows
more.</p>

<p>This is what our differences are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And have you responded to her when she said those things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She said this by means of newspapers and television.</p>

<p>I haven't seen her.</p>

<p>I would like to tell her that, but it is impossible to tell her that, because
she would scratch my eyes out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are there any other differences between you and your mother-in-law
that you have not described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, there are no more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know of any time that your husband had money in excess
of what he obtained from the jobs he was working on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He had his unemployment insurance when he was out of work.
Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then he had the earnings from his jobs, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, beyond those amounts, do you know of any sum of money
that he had from any source?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he was ever acting as an undercover agent
for the FBI.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you believe that he was at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not he was acting as an agent for the
CIA at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you believe that he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know Jack Ruby, the man that killed your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before the murder of your husband by Jack Ruby, had you ever
known of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether your husband knew Jack Ruby before the
killing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was not acquainted with him. Lee did not frequent nightclubs,
as the papers said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was always with me. He doesn't like other women. He
didn't drink. Why should he then go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know any reason why Jack Ruby killed your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About that, Jack Ruby should be questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I have to ask you, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And do you know any reason why he should?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know, but it seems to me that he was a sick person at
that time, perhaps. At least when I see his picture in the paper now, it is an
abnormal face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Has your husband ever mentioned the name Jack Ruby to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He never at any time said anything about Jack Ruby that you
can recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never. I heard that name for the first time after he killed
Lee.</p>

<p>I would like to consult with Mr. Thorne and Mr. Gopadze.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may.</p>

<p>(Brief recess)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, would you like to add something to your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This is in connection with why I left the room. I will
tell you why I left the room.</p>

<p>I consulted with my attorney, whether I should bring this up. This is not
a secret. The thing is that I have written a letter, even though I have not
mailed it yet, to the attorney&mdash;to the prosecuting attorney who will prosecute
Jack Ruby. I wrote in that letter that even&mdash;that if Jack Ruby killed my
husband, and I felt that I have a right as the widow of the man he killed to
say that, that if he killed him he should be punished for it. But that in accordance
with the laws here, the capital punishment, the death penalty is imposed
for such a crime, and that I do not want him to be subjected to that
kind of a penalty. I do not want another human life to be taken. And I don't
want it to be believed because of this letter that I had been acquainted with
Ruby, and that I wanted to protect him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
It is simply that it is pity to&mdash;I feel sorry for another human life. Because
this will not return&mdash;bring back to life Kennedy or the others who were killed.
But they have their laws, and, of course, I do not have the right to change
them. That is only my opinion, and perhaps they will pay some attention to it.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you ever been in the Carousel Nightclub?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never been in nightclubs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know where it was located before your husband
was killed by Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know it now either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us whether your husband was right handed or
left handed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he was right handed.</p>

<p>His brother writes with his left hand and so does&mdash;his brother and mother
both write with their left hand.</p>

<p>And since I mentioned Jack Ruby, the mother and Robert want Ruby to be
subjected to a death penalty. And in that we differ.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have they told you the reason why they wanted the death
penalty imposed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In their view, a killing has to be repaid by a killing.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is not so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything more about the assassination of President
Kennedy that you know that you have not told the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything that your husband ever told you about proposing
to assassinate President Kennedy that you haven't told the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, Mrs. Oswald, we will turn to some period in Russia,
and ask you about that for a little while.</p>

<p>Can you tell us the time and place of your birth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was born on July 17, 1941, in Severo Dvinsk, in the
Arkhangelskaya Region.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who were your parents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother was Clogia Vasilyevna Proosakova. She was a
laboratory assistant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And your father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And I had a stepfather. I had no father. I never knew
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who did you live with as a child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With my stepfather, with my mother, and sometimes with
my grandmother&mdash;grandmother on my mother's side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you live with your grandparents before you went back
to live with your mother and your stepfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I lived with my grandmother until I was approximately
five years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then you moved to live with your mother and your
stepfather, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was that in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After the war, we lived in Moldavia for some time. After
the war it was easier to live there, better to live there. And then we
returned to Leningrad where we lived with my stepfather's mother&mdash;also
with my half brother and half sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was your stepfather's business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was an electrician in a power station in Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One brother, one sister&mdash;from my mother's second marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How old were they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. How old are they, or were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are they&mdash;I mean in comparison with your age. Were they
three or four years older than you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My brother is 5 years younger than I am. My sister
is probably 9 years younger than I am. About four years between brother
and sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether your stepfather was a member of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is, you don't know, or you know he was not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I know that he was not a member.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you live for a period with your mother alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. After my mother's death, I continued to live with my
stepfather, and later went to live in Minsk, with my uncle&mdash;my mother's
brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was your stepfather's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Alexandr Ivanovich Medvedev.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you leave the home of your stepfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In 1961. No&mdash;1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was your grandfather's occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On my mother's side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was a ship's captain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He died shortly after the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Which war?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you get along well with your grandparents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I was their favorite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you get along with your stepfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I was not a good child. I was too fresh with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your mother and your stepfather move to Zguritsa?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is in Moldavia, where we lived. That is after the war.
It was a very good life there. They still had some kulaks, a lot of food,
and we lived very well.</p>

<p>After the war, people lived there pretty well, but they were dekulakized
subsequently.</p>

<p>By the way, I don't understand all of that, because these people worked with
their own hands all their lives. I was very sorry when I heard that everything
had been taken away from them and they had been sent somewhere to Siberia
where after living in the south it would be very cold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your mother have any occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, laboratory assistant&mdash;I said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was she a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall when your mother died?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you receive a pension after your mother's death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How much was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All children received pensions.</p>

<p>We received for it 3520 rubles, the old rubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that called a children's pension?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. It was paid up to majority, up to the age of 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was it paid to you directly or to your stepfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was paid to me directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your brother and sister get a similar pension?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your stepfather adopt you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I was not adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was your relationship with your half brother? Did you
get along with him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I loved them very much, and they loved me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And your half sister, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. They are very good children. Not like me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us what schools you went to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At first I went to school in Moldavia, and later in Leningrad,
in a girl's school and then after finishing school I studied in a pharmaceutical
institute&mdash;pharmaceutical school, rather than institute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was the pharmaceutical school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you go through high school before you went to the pharmaceutical
school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the names of any of your teachers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Dmitry Rossovsky. I remember the director of the school,
Nadelman Matvey Akimovich. It is hard to remember now. I have already
forgotten. I have had good teachers. They treated me very well, they helped
me after my mother died. Knowing my difficult nature, they approached me
very pedagogically. But now I would have changed that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you a good student?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was capable but lazy. I never spent much time studying.
You know, everything came to me very easily. Sometimes my ability saved me.
My language, you know&mdash;I talk a lot, and get a good grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you work part-time while you were going to school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. The money which I received on the pension was not
enough, and therefore I had to work as well as study.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what did you do in working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At first I worked in a school cafeteria, school lunchroom. This
was good for me, because I also got enough to eat that way.</p>

<p>And then I felt the work was not for me, that it was too restricted, and then
I worked in a pharmacy. Then when I graduated I worked in a pharmacy as
a full-fledged pharmacist&mdash;as a pharmacist's assistant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you graduated, how much were you paid for your work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think I received 36 per month&mdash;this is new rubles&mdash;at that
time it was still 360 old rubles. But I could eat there three times a day. And
then this was a lunchroom that was part of a large restaurant where everyone
liked me and I always was treated to all sorts of tidbits and candy. I remember
they had some busboys there who always saved something for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you save any money while you were working before you
graduated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know how to save money. I like to make presents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you work after you graduated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was assigned to work in Leningrad, but my stepfather didn't
want me to remain with him because he thought perhaps he would marry again,
and, therefore, I left.</p>

<p>But he hasn't married up until now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 20, and ask you if you know what that is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is my diploma. My goodness, what did they do with my
diploma?</p>

<p>I can't work with it. The government seal is missing. Who will give me a new
diploma?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I want to explain to you&mdash;the Commission hasn't
done anything to your diploma. We are informed <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They should have treated it a little more carefully, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The process was trying to determine fingerprints. It wasn't
our action.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There must be many fingerprints on there. All of my teachers
and everybody that ever looked at it. I am sorry&mdash;it is a pity for my diploma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 20.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be marked.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 20, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why on Exhibit 20 there is no date of admission
to the school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There is no entrance date on it, but it does show the date of
issue and the date of graduation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Isn't there a place for admission, though?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, there is a place for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know when you were admitted to the school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. I might mention the place here is for the year only, not for a full
date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. 1955, did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In this job that you obtained after you left the school, what
were your duties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When I worked in the pharmacy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I prepared prescriptions.
After the rounds every day, the doctors prescribed prescriptions, and the nurses
of each department of the hospital enter that in a book, and turn it over to the
pharmacy for preparation, where we again transcribed it from the nurses' book
as a prescription and prepared it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you assigned to a particular job or did you go out and
get the job? How was that arranged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Generally upon graduation there is an assignment. I was sent
to work to a drug warehouse in Leningrad. But this work was not very interesting,
because everything was in packages. It is more of a warehousing job.
And, therefore, if I had wanted to change I could have changed to any pharmacy.
This assignment is only performed in order to guarantee that the graduate has
a job. But the graduate can go to work somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did you stay in this first job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was there for three days, which is a probationary period,
intended to have the employee familiarize himself with his duties. I didn't like
that work, and I went to Minsk, and worked there. I worked there in my own
specialty with pleasure. But the reference which I received after I was going
to the United States was not very good, because they were very dissatisfied
with the fact that I was going to the United States. They could not understand
how could it be that a good worker could leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you select Minsk as a place to go and work yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You were not assigned there, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you have selected other places that you wished to go to
and work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, but the registration is very difficult. In Russia you cannot
settle in a large city if you are not registered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I lived in Leningrad, I had the right to work there. But if
someone would come there from a village he would not have the right to work,
because he was not registered and he would not be permitted to. But to move
from a larger city to a smaller one, then they may register, such as Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By register, do you mean that if you want to go to a place
like Leningrad, you had to be recorded some way in the city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is, registered in the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And if you were not registered, they would not give you a job,
is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>No, you would not get a job. There are people who want to come to Leningrad.
The housing problem has not been solved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us how you get registered if you would like to be
registered in Leningrad from some other point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First you must have relatives who might have some spare living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
space for a person. Sometimes people who have money buy that. You know
money does a great deal everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then after you have shown that you have a place to live,
do they register you as a matter of course, or do you have to have something
else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not always. One has to have connections, acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you registered in Leningrad before you left there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course. But if I had spent one year not living in Leningrad,
and were to return, I would not be registered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But since you were registered there, you could have found a
position in some pharmacy or pharmaceutical work there, could you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then, can you tell us how you decided to go to Minsk instead
of staying in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was very sorry to leave Leningrad, but there were family
circumstances.</p>

<p>What can one do?</p>

<p>It is not very pleasant to be a sty in the eye of a stepfather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So it is because you liked to leave your stepfather's home that
you sought some other city in which to work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I had no other place to live in Leningrad, and I did not
have enough money to pay for an apartment.</p>

<p>I received 45 and I would have had to pay 30 for an apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you have gotten a job in Leningrad if you stayed there
that would pay you so you could have an apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pharmaceutical workers received comparatively little, which
is quite undeserved, because they have to study so long, and it is responsible
work. Teachers and doctors also receive very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you conclude that you could not get a job that would pay
you enough to live in your own apartment in Leningrad, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I had an apartment in Leningrad. I would have had to
work overtime hours in order to be able to pay for it, because the normal workday
is only 6½ hours, because they consider that to be hazardous work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a social life while you were in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What do you mean by social life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have friends that you went out with in the evening,
pleasant times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. An awful lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So that except for the problem of your stepfather, you enjoyed
it there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any vacations while you were in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. After working in Minsk for one year I received a vacation
and went to a rest home near Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did you stay there on vacation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Three weeks. Three weeks in the rest home, and one week I
spent in Leningrad with some friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the name of the rest home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have to ask anyone in Leningrad in order to be able
to leave there to go to Minsk, or you just go to Minsk and ask the people there
to register you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I simply bought a ticket and went to Minsk, to my uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And were you registered there then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What kind of pay did you get when you worked in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Forty-five, as everywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that per week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, that is a month. That is not America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that 45 rubles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Per month?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Old rubles or new rubles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that old rubles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. New rubles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What were your hours in this work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 10 a.m., to 4:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you said this same pay was paid all over, did you mean
to say that you got the same amount regardless of whether you were in a big
city or a small city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the pharmacists rate everywhere. Unless you work in
a specialized sort of an institution, such as a military hospital&mdash;there the pay
is higher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the nature of your work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Preparation of prescriptions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you supervise the preparation of the prescriptions, or did
you just put them up yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I prepared them myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a supervisor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was in charge of myself. If I was working at a table, I was
responsible for it.</p>

<p>Of course every institution is in charge of a supervisor who does not prepare
medications&mdash;he is only an administrator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How many days of the week did you work on this job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Six days. Except if a holiday falls upon a weekday. Then I
didn't work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were these prescriptions prepared only for patients in the
hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Sometimes we prepared something for ourselves or for
friends, or somebody would ask us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you pay anything to your uncle and aunt for staying there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. They had&mdash;they were well provided for, and my uncle
wanted that I spend the money on myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the name of this uncle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ilva Vasilyevich Proosakov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the nature of his work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He works in the Ministry of the Interior of the Byelorussian
SSR.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have something to do with lumbering?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He is an engineer. He is a graduate of a forestry institute.
Technical institute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is he an officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was a colonel&mdash;a lieutenant colonel or colonel, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have a nice apartment compared with the others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, very nice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have a telephone in the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you supporting yourself during this period except for
the fact you didn't pay anything for your room and board?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you save money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I would receive my pay and I would spend everything in
one day&mdash;three days tops.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What would you spend it for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First all the necessary things which I had to buy&mdash;shoes, an
overcoat for winter. It is cold there, and, therefore, you have to wear warm
clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was your uncle a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he is a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you belong to any organizations during this period in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First I was a member of the Trade Union. Then I joined the
Comsomol, but I was discharged after one year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why you were discharged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I paid my membership dues regularly, and at first they didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
know who I was or what I was, but after they found out that I had married an
American and was getting ready to go to the United States, I was discharged
from the Comsomol. They said that I had anti-Soviet views, even though I
had no anti-Soviet views of any kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you think that they thought you had anti-Soviet views because
you married an American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They didn't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they give any reason, other than the fact that you had
them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They never gave that as a direct reason, because the Soviet
Government was not against marrying an American. But every small official
wants to keep his place, and he is afraid of any troubles. I think it was sort
of insurance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any kind of a hearing about your being let out of
the Comsomol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you attend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't go there, and they discharged me without me&mdash;I was
very glad. There was even a reporter there from Comsomol paper, Comsomol
Pravda, I think. He tried to shame me quite strongly&mdash;for what, I don't know.
And he said that he would write about this in the paper, and I told him "Go ahead
and write."</p>

<p>But he didn't write anything, because, after all, what could he write?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you make any objection to being removed from the
Comsomol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you belong to any social clubs there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you belong to any culture groups?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you go out with groups of students in the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you came to the United States, did you correspond with
some of these friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, but these were not the same friends. They were generally
some girl friends before I was married and some friends we made later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a social life there at Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did that social life consist of? Did you go to parties or
to the opera or theater, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sometimes we met at the home of some friends. Of course
we went to the opera, to the theater, to concerts, to the circus. To a restaurant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first meet Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first time when I went to a dance, to a party. And there
I met Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On March 4th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes&mdash;but can you tell us the place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the Palace of Trade Unions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What kind of a place is that? Is that where there are public
meetings?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sometimes they do have meetings there. Sometimes it is also
rented by some institutes who do not have their own halls for parties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They have dances?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Every Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did someone introduce you to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who introduced you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had gone there with my friends from the medical institute,
and one of them introduced me to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yuri Mereginsky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know by what name Lee Oswald was introduced to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Everyone there called him Alec, at his place of work, because
Lee is an unusual, cumbersome name. For Russians it was easier&mdash;this was
easier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is Alec a name close to Lee, as far as the Russian language is
concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A little. Somewhat similar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know that Lee Oswald was an American when you first
met him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I found that out at the end of that party, towards the end of
that party, when I was first introduced to him, I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did that make any difference?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was more interesting, of course. You don't meet Americans
very often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After this first meeting, did you meet him a number of times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you describe just briefly how you met him and saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After the first meeting he asked me where he could meet me
again. I said that perhaps some day I will come back here again, to the Palace.
About a week later I came there again with my girl friend, and he was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he have a period that he was in the hospital there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had arranged to meet with him again. I had already given
him a telephone number. But he went to a hospital and he called me from there.
We had arranged to meet on a Friday, and he called from the hospital and said
he couldn't because he was in the hospital and I should come there, if I could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn what was wrong with him then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was near the ear, nose and throat section and it seems that
he had something wrong with his ears and also the glands or polyps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you visit him regularly for some period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, quite frequently, because I felt sorry for him being there
alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you observe a scar on his left arm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had a scar, but I found that out only after we were married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you find out about that scar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When I asked him about it, he became very angry and asked
me never to ask about that again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever explain to you what caused the scar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever learn what caused the scar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I found out here, now, recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn that he had tried to commit suicide at some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I found that out now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During the time Lee Oswald was courting you, did he talk about
America at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you recall that he said about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time, of course, he was homesick, and perhaps he was
sorry for having come to Russia. He said many good things. He said that his
home was warmer and that people lived better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he talk about returning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he describe the life in America as being very attractive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. At least in front of others he always defended it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is strange to reconcile this. When he was there he was
saying good things about America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when he was talking only to you, did he do that, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you were married, did you find out anything about his
plans to return to America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn anything before you were married about the fact
that there might be some doubt whether he could return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Once before we were married we had a talk and I asked him
whether he could return to the United States if he wanted to, and he said no,
he could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. At that time, he didn't. He said that when he had arrived,
he had thrown his passport on a table and said that he would not return any
more to the United States. He thought that they would not forgive him such
an act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you were married, did you ever say to him you would
like to go to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what attracted you to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. First, the fact that he was&mdash;he didn't look like
others. You could see he was an American. He was very neat, very polite, not
the way he was here, not as you know him here. And it seemed that he would
be a good family man. And he was good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you talk about many things when you were together, when
he was courting you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We talked about everything, about the moon and the weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was he living at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Minsk. By the way, on the same street where I lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have an apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. By the way, this was the same apartment where I had
dreamed to live. I didn't know about it yet. It had a very beautiful balcony,
terrace. I would look at that building sometimes and say it would be good to
visit in that building, visit someone there, but I never thought that I would wind
up living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you describe the number of rooms there were in his apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We had a small room&mdash;one room, kitchen, foyer, and bathroom.
A large terrace, balcony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what he paid for rent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For two it was quite sufficient. Seven and a half rubles per
month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Wasn't that pretty cheap for such a nice apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was cheap.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this apartment nicer than most in this city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, in that city they have good apartments because the houses
are new. That is, on a Russian scale, of course. You cannot compare it to
private houses people live in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have an automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, no. In Russia this is a problem. In Russia it is difficult
to have an automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have a television set?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Only a radio receiver, a record player.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;I don't like television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The programs are not always interesting, and you can get into
a stupor just watching television. It is better to go to the movies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was his occupation at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He worked in a radio plant in Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what his work was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As an ordinary laborer&mdash;metal worker. From that point of view,
he was nothing special. I had a greater choice in the sense that many of my
friends were engineers and doctors. But that is not the main thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did others with a similar job have similar apartments?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The house in which we lived belonged to the factory in which
Lee worked. But, of course, no one had a separate apartment for only two persons.
I think that Lee had been given better living conditions, better than others,
because he was an American. If Lee had been Russian, and we would have had
two children, we could not have obtained a larger apartment. But since he was
an American, we would have obtained the larger one. It seems to me that in
Russia they treat foreigners better than they should. It would be better if
they treated Russians better. Not all foreigners are better than the Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say whether he liked this job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he didn't like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First of all, he was being ordered around by someone. He didn't
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And the fact that it was comparatively dirty work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about the Russian system, whether he liked
it or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He didn't like it. Not everything, but some things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about Communists and whether he liked
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't like Russian Communists. He said that they joined
the party not because of the ideas, but in order to obtain better living conditions
and to get the benefit of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did it appear to you that he had become disenchanted with the
Soviet system?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he had expected much more when he first arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever tell you why he came to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He said he had read a great deal about Russia, he was
interested in seeing the country, which was the first in the Socialist camp about
which much had been said, and he wanted to see it with his own eyes. And,
therefore, he wanted to be not merely a tourist, who is being shown only the
things that are good, but he wanted to live among the masses and see.</p>

<p>But when he actually did, it turned out to be quite difficult.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think we better adjourn now for the day.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10 a.m. on February 6, 1964, at
200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator John Sherman
Cooper, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and
Allen W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Melvin Aron Eisenberg,
assistant counsel; Norman Redlich, assistant counsel; William D. Krimer, and
Leon I. Gopadze, interpreters; and John M. Thorne, attorney for Mrs. Lee
Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. We will proceed again.
Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, if I may return a moment with you to the time
that you told us about your husband practicing with the rifle at Love Field.
As I recall your testimony, you said that he told you that he had taken
the rifle and practiced with it there, is that right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I knew that he practiced with it there. He told me, later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And by practicing with it, did you mean that he fired the rifle
there, as you understood it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what he did with it there. He probably fired it.
But I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then you said that you had seen him cleaning it after he
came back, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, do you recall your husband having any ammunition
around the house at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where do you remember his having it in the places
you lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Neely Street, in Dallas, and New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether that was rifle ammunition or rifle and
pistol ammunition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think it was for the rifle. Perhaps he had some pistol
ammunition there, but I would not know the difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you observe how much ammunition he had at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had a box of about the size of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you give us a little description of how you indicated
the box? Was it 2 or 3 inches wide?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About the size here on the pad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About 3 inches wide and 6 inches long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, do you recall that you said to your husband at any
time that he was just studying Marxism so he could get attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In order to cause him not to be so involved in some of these
ideas, did you laugh at some of his ideas that he told you about, and make
fun of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he react to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He became very angry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did he ask you at one time, or sometimes, not to make
fun of his ideas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, returning to the period in Russia, while your husband
was courting you, did you talk to him, he talk to you, about his childhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not very much. Only in connection with photographs,
where he was a boy in New York, in the zoo. Then in the Army&mdash;there is a
snapshot taken right after he joined the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you about anything he resented about his
childhood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said it was hard for him during his childhood, when he
was a boy, because there was a great age difference between him and Robert,
and Robert was in some sort of a private school. He also wanted to have a
chance to study, but his mother was working, and he couldn't get into a private
school, and he was very sorry about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In talking about that, did he indicate a feeling that he had
not had as good an opportunity as his brother Robert?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he talked about his service in the Marines, did he tell
you much about what he did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't talk much about it, because there wasn't very
much there of interest to me. But he was satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he indicate that he was unhappy about his service with the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he had good memories of his service in the Army.   He said
that the food was good and that sometimes evenings he had a chance to go out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about his mother during this period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was before we were married. I had once asked Lee whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
he had a mother, and he said he had no mother. I started to question him as to
what had happened, what happened to her, and he said that I should not question
him about it.</p>

<p>After we were married, he told me that he had not told me the truth, that he
did have a mother, but that he didn't love her very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you why he didn't love her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall anything more he said about his brother Robert
at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he had a good wife, that he had succeeded fairly
well in life, that he was smart and capable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about having any affection for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he loved Robert. He said that when Robert married Vada
that his mother had been against the marriage and that she had made a scene,
and this was one of the reasons he didn't like his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about his half brother, by the name of
Pic&mdash;I guess the last name was Pic&mdash;Robert Pic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he had a half brother by the name of Pic from
his mother's first marriage, but he didn't enlarge upon the subject. It is only
that I knew he had a half brother by that name.</p>

<p>He said that at one time they lived with this John Pic and his wife, but that
his wife and the mother frequently had arguments, quarrels. He said it was
hard for him to witness these scenes, it was unpleasant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you regard your husband's wage or salary at Minsk as high
for the work he was doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He received as much as the others in similar jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband have friends in Minsk when you first met
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he seem to get along with these friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had a very good relationship with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he discuss any of them with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us when you married your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. April 30, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there a marriage ceremony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not in a church, of course. But in the institution called Zags,
where we were registered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anyone else present at the ceremony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, our friends were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who else was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No one besides my girlfriends and some acquaintances. My
uncle and aunt were busy preparing the house, and they were not there for that
reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you were married did you go to live in your husband's
apartment there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you buy any new furniture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was your baby born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. February 15, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. June Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you stop working before the birth of the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you return to work after the baby was born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you and your husband get along during the period that
you were in Minsk, after you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We lived well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you a member of the trade union at Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a membership booklet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, a booklet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 21 and ask you if that is the trade union
booklet that you had there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never have a good photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 21.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 21 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you pay dues to the trade union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We didn't notice any notation of dues payments in this booklet,
Exhibit 21. Do you know why that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I forgot to paste the stamps in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is for the period between 1956 and 1959, they don't seem to
be in there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you made the payments&mdash;you just didn't put the stamps in,
is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Simply because this is not important. I got the stamps,
but the stubs remained with the person to whom I made the payment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We noted that the book shows a birth date of 1940 rather than
1941. Do you know how that happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The girl who prepared this booklet thought that I was older
and put down 1940 instead of 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The booklet doesn't seem to show any registration in Minsk.
Do you know why that would occur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because the booklet was issued in Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is it the practice to record a registration in a city that you move
to, or isn't that a practice that is followed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband engage in any Communist Party activities
while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not at all&mdash;absolutely not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he was a member of any organization
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that he was also a member of a trade union, as everybody
who works belongs to a trade union. Then he had a card from a hunting
club, but he never visited it. He joined the club, apparently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he go hunting while he was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We only went once, with him and with my friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that when he went hunting for squirrels?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If he marked it down in his notebook that he went hunting for
squirrels, he never did. Generally they wanted to kill a squirrel when we went
there, or some sort of a bird, in order to boast about it, but they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were there any times while he was in the Soviet Union after
your marriage that you didn't know where he went?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first learn that he was planning to try to go back
to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After we were married, perhaps a month after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss the matter at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We didn't discuss it&mdash;we talked about it&mdash;because we didn't
make any specific plans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what you said about it then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said, "Well, if we will go, we will go. If we remain, it
doesn't make any difference to me. If we go to China, I will also go."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you and your husband make a trip to Moscow in connection
with your plans to go to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. We went to the American Embassy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband make a trip to Moscow alone before that?
About his passport?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't go alone. He actually left a day early and the following
morning I was to come there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I understood that he didn't get any permission to make this
trip to Moscow away from Minsk. Do you know whether that is true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know about this. I know that he bought a ticket and
he made the flight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. According to the practice, then, would he be permitted to go to
Moscow from Minsk without the permission of the authorities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know whether he had the right to go to Moscow. Perhaps
he did, because he had a letter requesting him to visit the Embassy. But
he could not go to another city without permission of the authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When the decision was made to come to the United States, did
you discuss that with your family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First when we made the decision, we didn't know what would
come of it later, what would happen further. And Lee asked me not to talk
about it for the time being.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Later, did you discuss it with your family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Later when I went to visit the Embassy, my aunt found out
about it, because they had telephoned from work, and she was offended because
I had not told her about it. They were against our plan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell your friends about your plans after you were
trying to arrange to go to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there some opposition by people in the Soviet Union to your
going to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Somewhat. You can't really call that opposition. There
were difficult times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First, the fact that I was excluded from the Komsomol. This
was not a blow for me, but it was, of course, unpleasant. Then all kinds of
meetings were arranged and members of the various organizations talked to
me. My aunt and uncle would not talk to me for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And that was all because you were planning to go to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you hospitalized and received medical treatment because
of all of these things that happened at that time, about your leaving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any nervous disorder in 1961 that you were hospitalized
for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was nervous, but I didn't go to the hospital. I am nervous
now, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then you went to Kharkov on a vacation, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>If you have a record of the fact that I was in the hospital, yes, I was. But
I was in the hospital only as a precaution because I was pregnant. I have a
negative Rh factor, blood Rh factor, and if Lee had a positive they thought&mdash;they
thought that he had positive&mdash;even though he doesn't. It turned out that
we both had the same Rh factor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you receive a promotion about this time in the work you
were doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, no one gets promoted. You work for 10 years as an assistant.
All the assistants were on the same level. There were no sub-managers,
except for the manager who was in charge of the pharmacy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What I am asking is your becoming an assistant druggist. Was
that something different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At first I was&mdash;I have to call it&mdash;an analyst. My job was to
check prescriptions that had been prepared. There was no vacancy for an
assistant, pharmacy assistant at first. But then I liked the work of a pharmacist's
assistant better, and I changed to that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 22 and ask you if that is a book that
shows that you were promoted or became an assistant druggist.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The entry here said, "Hired as chemist analyst of the
pharmacy."</p>

<p>The next entry says, "Transferred to the job of pharmacy assistant."</p>

<p>These are simply different types of work. But one is not any higher than the
other&mdash;not because one is a type of management and the other is not. If someone
prepared a prescription and I checked it, that was no different from the
other work. There is a difference, of course, but not in the sense of a grade of
service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 22.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 22, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I ask leave at this time to substitute photostatic
copies of any documentary evidence offered, and photographs of any physical
evidence, with the understanding that the originals will be held subject to
the further order of the Commission.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well. That may be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you aware of your husband's concern about being prosecuted
with regard to his returning to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he told me about it. He told me about it, that perhaps he
might even be arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he fearful of prosecution by the Soviet Union or by the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any time that the Soviet authorities visited your
husband while you were trying to go to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the occasion for your traveling to Kharkov in 1961?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother's sister lives there, and she had invited me to come
there for a rest because I was on vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anyone go with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did you stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Three weeks, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you write to your husband while you were gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was your aunt's name Mikhilova?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mikhilova, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any reason why you took this vacation alone and
not with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was working at that time. He didn't have a vacation.
He wanted to go with me, but he could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what delayed your departure to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. There was some correspondence with the Embassy about your
husband returning alone. Did you ever discuss that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about that, and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that if he did go alone, he feared that they would not
permit me to leave, and that he would, therefore, wait for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I thanked him for the fact that he wanted to wait for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you stay in Moscow when you went there about your
visa?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At first, we stopped at the Hotel Ostamkino. And then we
moved to the Hotel Berlin, formerly Savoy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long were you there on that trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think about 10 days, perhaps a little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever have any status in the armed forces of the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. But all medical workers, military, are obligated&mdash;all medical
workers have a military obligation. In the event of a war, we would be in
first place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever learn from your husband how he paid his expenses
in Moscow for the period prior to the time you went to Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 23 and ask you if that is a booklet that
records your military status.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't work. It is simply that I was obligated. There is
an indication there "non-Party member".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 23.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be received.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 23, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As I understand you, you did not serve in the armed forces of
the Soviet Union, but because of your ability as a pharmacist, you were obligated,
if the call was ever extended to you, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know any reason why your husband was permitted to
stay in the Soviet Union when he first came there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know <span class="locked">why&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Many were surprised at that&mdash;here and in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why he went to Minsk, or was allowed to go to
Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was sent to Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By that, you mean by direction of the government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband do any writing while he was in the Soviet
Union that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he wrote a diary about his stay in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 24 and ask you if that is a photostatic copy
of the diary that you have just referred to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is Lee's handwriting. It is a pity that I don't understand
it.</p>

<p>Is that all? It seems to me there was more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, that is all of the historic diary that we have received.
There are some other materials that I will call your attention to, but
apparently they are not part of that.</p>

<p>I offer in evidence Exhibit 24.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted and take the next number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 24, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is all that only has reference to this? Or is that everything
that Lee had written?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No, it is not all that he ever wrote, but it is all that apparently
fits together as a part of the descriptive diary in regard to the time he was in
Russia.</p>

<p>Do you know when your husband made Exhibit 24, as compared with doing
it daily or from time to time&mdash;how it was made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sometimes two or three days in a row. Sometimes he would
not write at all. In accordance with the way he felt about it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you said a few moments ago it was a pity
that you could not read this. Would you like to have the interpreter read it
to you later, so you will know what is in it?</p>

<p>You may, if you wish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Some other time, later, when I know English myself perhaps.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may see it any time you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I just heard Mr. Thorne ask if there was any
reason why they could not have photocopies of the exhibits. I know no reason.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. No, there is no reason why you cannot. You may have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald has raised the question about whether this was
complete. And this was all that was given us, as Exhibit 24, but we are going
to check back on it to determine whether there was anything that may have
been overlooked by the Bureau when they gave it to us.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald, your husband apparently made another diary that he wrote on
some paper of the Holland America Line. Are you familiar with that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will hand you Exhibit 25 and ask you if you recall having
seen that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know this paper, but I didn't know what was contained in it.
I didn't know this was a diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Possibly I misdescribed it, Mrs. Oswald. It may be more accurately
described as a story of his experiences in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know even when he wrote this, whether this was
aboard the ship or after we came to the United States. I only know the paper
itself and the handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether it is your husband's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 25.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 25, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall how much money you and your husband had in
savings when you left Moscow for the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know, because Lee did not tell me how much money he
had, because he knew that if he would tell me I would spend everything. But
I think that we might have had somewhere about 300 rubles, or somewhat more,
350 perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you travel from Moscow to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I told you&mdash;from Moscow by train, through Poland, Germany,
and Holland, and from Holland by boat to New York. From New York to
Dallas by air.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I think you told us by another ship from Holland. I wonder
if it wasn't the SS <i>Maasdam</i>. Does that refresh your memory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps. I probably am mixed up in the names because it is
a strange name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that you exchanged United States money for
Polish money during this trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, in Warsaw, on the black market.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you buy food there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Some good Polish beer and a lot of candy.</p>

<p>By the way, we got an awful lot for one dollar, they were so happy to get it.
More than the official rate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband drink then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He doesn't drink beer, he doesn't drink anything, he
doesn't like beer. I drank the beer. I don't like wine, by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that you or your husband were contacted at any
time in the Soviet Union by Soviet Intelligence people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During the time your husband was in the Soviet Union, did
you observe any indication of mental disorder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he appear to get along with people that he knew in the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Very well. At least, he had friends there. He didn't have
any here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How much time did you spend in Amsterdam on the way to the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two or three days, it seems to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Walked around the city, did some sightseeing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anybody visit you there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you visit anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What hotel did you stay in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We didn't stop at a hotel. We stopped at a place where they
rent apartments. The address was given to us in the American Embassy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what you paid in the way of rent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, Lee paid it. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did your husband spend his time when he was aboard the
ship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was somewhat upset because he was a little ashamed to walk
around with me, because I wasn't dressed as well as the other girls. Basically,
I stayed in my cabin while Lee went to the movies and they have different
games there. I don't know what he did there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In Exhibit 25, the notations on the Holland American Line
stationery, your husband apparently made some political observations. Did
he discuss these with you while he was on the trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, it is time for a recess.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. We will take a recess now.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>We will continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, can you tell us what your husband was reading
in the Soviet Union after you were married, that you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He read the Daily Worker newspaper in the English language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems to me something like Marxism, Leninism, also in the
English language. He did not have any choice of English books for reading
purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was he reading anything in Russian at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, newspapers, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No library books?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. It was very hard for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he go to any schools while he was in the Soviet Union
that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 26 and ask you if you can tell us what that is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The title of this document is shown here, "Information for
those who are departing for abroad. Personal data&mdash;name, last name, date of
birth, place of birth, height, color of eyes and hair, married or not, and purpose
of the trip."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What does it say about the purpose of the trip&mdash;do you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Private exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what members of your family are referred to
there under that question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It shows here "none." I think before this was filled out&mdash;this
was before June's birth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That doesn't refer then to members of your family, like your
uncles or aunts, or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence Exhibit 26.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 26, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, I hand you Exhibit 27 and ask you if you can recall what
that is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a questionnaire which has to be filled out prior to
departure for abroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 27.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 27, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what relatives you referred to when they asked
for close relatives?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It must be shown there. I don't remember. Probably my uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, can you tell us the handwriting on this exhibit,
No. 27?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is my handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You say it is all your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, can you tell us what Exhibit 28 is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is the same thing. This was a draft.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean a rough draft?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A rough draft of the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the other one is the final?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know. Perhaps there were several drafts, I don't know
whether this is from the Embassy or from some other source. These are drafts,
because the original would have had to have my photograph. Lee and I were
playing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then, Mrs. Oswald, you think both Exhibit 27 and 28 are
drafts, since neither one has your photograph on them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. We were playing dominoes, and this is the score.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I ask that Exhibit 28 be received in evidence, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 28, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit 29 and ask you if you can tell us what
that is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a residence permit, passport&mdash;a passport for abroad.
This is a foreign passport for Russians who go abroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you understand that you had six months in which to leave
under that passport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This all has to be filled out before you are allowed to
go abroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Whose handwriting is in Exhibit 29?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know who wrote that. It is not I. Officials who issue
the passport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 29.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 29, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know any reason why the passport was made valid
until January 11, 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because the passport which I turned in and for which I received
this one in exchange was valid until 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You had a passport prior to this one, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you obtained that before you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All citizens of the U.S.S.R. 16 and over must have a passport.
It would be good if everyone had a passport here. It would help the Government
more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you have told us considerably about your husband's
unhappiness with the United States and his idea that things would be much
better in Cuba, if he could get there. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what he said about what he didn't like about the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The problem of unemployment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I already said what he didn't like&mdash;that it was hard to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
an education, that medical care is very expensive. About his political dissatisfaction,
he didn't speak to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever say anything against the leaders of the government
here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, that is all we have now except the physical
exhibits, and I think we could do that at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, we are going to recess now until 2 o'clock. You
must be quite tired by now. And this afternoon we are going to introduce some
of the physical objects that are essential to make up our record.</p>

<p>When we finish with those, I think your testimony will be completed.</p>

<p>And I think we should finish today.</p>

<p>You won't be unhappy about that, will you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. 2 o'clock this afternoon.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 11:35 a.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LEE HARVEY OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. Mr. Rankin, you may
continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, I understand that Mrs. Oswald has examined
a considerable volume of correspondence during the recess. In order to be
helpful, she has identified it, and she is able to tell, through her counsel,
by a number for each exhibit, who the letter was to or from as the case may be.</p>

<p>And, after I offer the exhibits, or as part of the offer, I will ask Mr. Thorne
if he will tell the description of the recipient and the writer of the letter in
the various cases. These exhibits are Exhibits 30 through 65, inclusive.</p>

<p>May I see Exhibit 49? I am trying to clear up a point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is the date of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is not a letter. That is an autobiography.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Yes, that is correct. It is the draft of an autobiography for
the Russian Consulate.</p>

<p>Exhibit No. 50 is a letter from a friend Erick Titovetz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibits 30 through 65, inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted and take the appropriate numbers.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit Nos. 30 through
65, inclusive, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you remember I asked you about the diary that
your husband kept. You said that he completed it in Russia before he came to
this country, do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether or not the entries that he made in that
diary were made each day as the events occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not each day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were they noted shortly after the time they occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not all events. What happened in Moscow I don't think that
Lee wrote that in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about the entries concerning what happened in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He wrote this while he was working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you think those entries were made close to the time that
the events occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As I understand you, you think that the entries concerning the
time he was in Moscow before he went to Minsk were entered some time while
he was in Minsk, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think so, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why your husband was sent to Minsk to work and
live after he came to the Soviet Union, instead of some other city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was sent there because this is a young and developing city
where there are many industrial enterprises which needed personnel. It is an
old, a very old city. But after the war, it had been almost completely built
anew, because everything has been destroyed. It was easier in the sense of
living space in Minsk&mdash;it was easier to secure living space. Many immigrants
are sent to Minsk. There are many immigrants there now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were there many Americans there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Americans? No. But from South America, from Argentina,
we knew many. Many Argentinians live there&mdash;comparatively many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did your husband say much about the time he was in Moscow
before he went to Minsk and what he did there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He didn't tell me particularly much about it, but he said that
he walked in Moscow a great deal, that he had visited museums, that he liked
Moscow better than Minsk, and that he would have liked to live in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about having been on the radio or television
at Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said that he was on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you anything about any ceremonies for him when
he asked for Soviet citizenship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When he was not granted Soviet citizenship, did he say anything
about the Soviet Government or his reaction towards their failure to give
him citizenship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When I read the diary, I concluded from the diary that Lee
wanted to become a citizen of the Soviet Union and that he had been refused, but
after we were married we talked on that subject and he said it was good that he
had refused to accept citizenship. Therefore, I had always thought that Lee
had been offered citizenship&mdash;but that he didn't want it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What diary are you referring to that you read?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The diary about which we talked here previously&mdash;in the
preceding session.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The one that was completed in Russia that you referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did you first read that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had never read it, because I didn't understand English. But
when I was questioned by the FBI, they read me excerpts from that diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And that was after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you and Lee Oswald decided to get married, was there a
period of time you had to wait before it could be official?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you file an application and then have a period to wait?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long was that period of waiting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ten days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After it was known in Minsk that you were to marry this American,
did any officials come to you and talk to you about the marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, we have Exhibits 66 through 91 that we are going
to ask your counsel to show to you, and after you have looked at them and are
satisfied that you can identify them, then we will ask you to comment on them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is from Lee when I was in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What exhibit is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. These are all part of Exhibit 66. They are various miscellaneous
pieces of writing involved in this particular exhibit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was not in June that I was in the hospital. He didn't know
that I was in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By "he" do you mean your husband Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did he not know that you were in the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because I was going to work when I began to feel ill, and I
was taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what time was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the morning, about 10 a.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I mean about what day or month or year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. September 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that before you went to Kharkov?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And we have already discussed, or I have asked you about that
time you were in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I was there twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By twice, you mean this time you have described before you
went to Kharkov and the other time when you had the baby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a letter from Inesse Yakhliel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 67?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. No, sir, these are all part of Exhibit 66.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if these should not be marked in some way, because
you won't be able to find out what they are in the future&mdash;A, B, C, D, or something
of this kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Redlich, will you mark those as 66-A, B, C, and D, or
however they run?</p>

<p>Mr. Thorne, when you say the first one marked "A", will you make it clear
what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. The exhibit marked "A"&mdash;let me hasten to point out that all of
these pieces of paper have a mark "159R". We are denoting individually these
papers by starting with A, B, C, and so on.</p>

<p>"A" represents the first piece of paper that was identified earlier in this
testimony by Mrs. Oswald, referring again specifically to Exhibit 66, which
is composed of many such pieces of paper.</p>

<p>Exhibit B was the second piece of paper that was identified by Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>I believe this is the third.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a letter from Inessa Yakhliel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This will be identified as C.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The envelope of a letter that Lee wrote me, to Kharkov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. That is identified as Exhibit D.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From Inessa Yakhliel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is identified as Exhibit E.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is from Inessa Yakhliel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is identified as Exhibit F.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Identified as Exhibit G.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From my Aunt Luba.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is identified as Exhibit H.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a letter from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit I.</p>

<p>Now, so there is no confusion, let's state again that these are sub-exhibits,
letters, and marked 159, from A through I, all part of Exhibit 66.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would like to obtain these letters, to preserve them. I don't
mean now.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. She may see and have copies of any of the letters she desires
connected with her testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is Exhibit 67.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A photograph of Galiya Khontooleva.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 68. Exhibit 68 is two postcards, and they probably
need to be identified as A and B.</p>

<p>Let's identify A.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a letter from Lee from New Orleans to Irving&mdash;to the
home of Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>And this is a letter from the mother, Lee's mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This will be identified as Exhibit 68-B. Exhibit 69 is composed
of two postcards. Exhibit <span class="locked">69-A&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is from Lee, from New Orleans, addressed to me, when
I lived with Ruth Paine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. That is Exhibit B.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A letter to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 72 is a writing. In Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a reply to Lee's letter about the fact that he wanted
to study at the University of Peoples Friendship, and he was refused.</p>

<span class="locked">as&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is from the time that June was a little baby, a certificate
of the fact that she was vaccinated for smallpox.</p>

Moscow&mdash;the State Library.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A letter from Galiya Khontooleva, and an envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 76 contains three pages of writing, together with an
envelope.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was when Lee and I visited his brother in a city in
Alabama, he is studying to be a clergyman. There we met a young man who
was studying Russian, and he wrote me this letter.</p>

<p>These are all his letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is three pages of one letter together with the envelope.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 77 contains an envelope and two written pages&mdash;two
separate pages of writing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. By the same, you mean what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A receipt for the receipt of money through the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Are these donations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A letter from Ella Soboleva.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. And the letter arrived in the envelope?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 89 contains one sheet of writing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Also from Soboleva.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit No. 90.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think from Ruth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This contains several pages&mdash;several sheets&mdash;three sheets which
seem to be one continuous letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A letter from Ruth Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. A three-page letter. Exhibit No. 91 contains an envelope.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From Erick Titovetz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibits 66 through 91, inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You have looked over all these, have you, Mr. Thorne, and
your client has identified them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit Nos. 66 through
91, inclusive, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, we will show you photostatic copies of various
writings of your husband. As you look at them, would you tell us what each
one is, insofar as you recognize them, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is Exhibit 92, which is a writing, a photocopy of a writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize that exhibit, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's handwriting. But I have never seen this. More correctly,
I have seen it, but I have never read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So you don't know what it purports to be, I take it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is, you do not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you do recognize his handwriting throughout?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. May I point out to the Commission, please, this is in English.
This is handwritten in English and it is typewritten in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 92.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 92, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I should like to inform the Commission that Exhibit 92 purports
to be the book that Lee Oswald wrote about conditions in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The one that was dictated to the stenographer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. He had had written notes, and she transcribed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. The next exhibit is Exhibit No. 93, many pages, handwritten,
in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, will you tell us what that is, if you know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether it is in the handwriting of your
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, this is Lee's handwriting. These are all his papers. I
don't know about them. Everything is in English. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 93.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Exhibit 93 may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 93, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I should like to advise the Commission that this Exhibit
93 purports to be a résumé of his Marine Corps experience, and some additional
minor notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit No. 94 is photocopies of many pages of handwriting,
which is in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what that is. It is Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 94.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 94,
and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do we know what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 94 consists of handwritten pages on which the book
about Russia, Exhibit 92, was typewritten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit No. 95 is a photocopy of many pages of typewriting,
typewritten words, which are in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I also don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I will ask you, on Exhibit 95, can you identify
the handwriting on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you ever see the pages of that Exhibit 95 as a
part of his papers and records?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Perhaps I saw them, but I don't remember them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you know it is his handwriting, where the handwriting
appears?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 95.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 95, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 96 is a photocopy of two pages that are handwritten
and in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I also don't know what that is. For me, that is a dark
forest, a heap of papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. With regard to Exhibit 95 that has been received in evidence,
I should like to inform the Commission that that is also material concerning
the book, regarding conditions in Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald, will you tell us with regard to Exhibit 96&mdash;do you recognize
the handwriting on those pages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is all Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 96.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 96, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 96 purports to be notes for a speech or article, on
"The New Era."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 97 is a photocopy of several pages, both printed and
in writing, handwriting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is amazing that Lee had written so well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is also in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald, you state he had written so well. By that you mean what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Neatly. And legibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 97.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Exhibit 97 may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 97, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 98 is three photocopy pages of handwriting in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 97 appears to be a critique on the Communist Party
in the United States by Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 98.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 98, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 98 purports to be notes for a speech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 99 is one photocopy page of handwriting in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Is this Lee's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 99.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 99, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit No. 100 purports to be four pages, photocopy pages, of
handwriting, in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's handwriting. But what it is, I don't know. I am sorry,
but I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 100.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 100, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I wish to inform the Commission that this purports to be answers
to questionnaires, and shows two formats, one showing that he is loyal to
the country and another that he is not so loyal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 101 is a photocopy of one page which is printed and
handwritten in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's handwriting. But what it is, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 101.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 101, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This purports to be a portion of the diary and relates to his
meeting at the Embassy on October 31, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 102 is photocopies of two pages, handwritten, in
English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's handwriting. I don't know what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 102.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 102, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I wish to call the Commission's attention to the fact that Exhibit
102 purports to be a draft of memoranda, at least, for a speech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 103 is two pages, two photocopy pages, of handwriting,
in English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From the address I see that it is a letter&mdash;it is Lee's letter,
but to whom, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 103.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted under that number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 103, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I wish to call the attention of the Commission to the fact that
Exhibit 103 is a purported draft of the letter that Lee Oswald sent to the
Embassy, the Soviet Embassy, which you will recall referred to the fact that
his wife was asked by the FBI to defect&mdash;had such language in the latter part
of it. This draft shows that in this earlier draft he used different language,
and decided upon the language that he finally sent in the exhibit that is in the
record earlier. The comparison is most illuminating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 104 is photocopy pages of a small notebook.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is my notebook, various addresses&mdash;when I was at the
rest home, I simply noted down the addresses of some acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is this in Russia, or the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 104.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 104, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 105 is a <span class="locked">notebook&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 104 purports to be a small notebook of Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 105 is the original of a notebook containing various
writings in English and in Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is when Lee was getting ready to go to Russia, and he
made a list of the things that he wanted to buy and take with him.</p>

<p>Further, I don't know what he had written in there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this the time he went or the time he didn't go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he didn't&mdash;when he intended to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In Exhibit 105, Mrs. Oswald, I will ask you if you noted that
your husband had listed in that "Gun and case, Price 24 REC. 17."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what that is. Unfortunately, I cannot help. I
don't know what this means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you do observe the item in the list in that booklet, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Now I see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 105.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That will be received.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 105, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. With regard to Exhibit 102, I should like to inform the Commission
that as a part of this transcribed record, as soon as we can complete it,
we will have photostatic copies of these various exhibits for you, along with
photographs of the physical material. But I think you will want to examine
some of it very closely.</p>

<p>I call your particular attention to this draft of a proposed speech. One of
the items, No. 1, states, "Americans are apt to scoff at the idea that a military
coup in the U.S. as so often happens in Latin American countries, could ever
replace our government. But that is an idea that has grounds for consideration.
Which military organization has the potentialities of exciting such
action? Is it the Army? With its many conscripts, its unwieldy size, its score
of bases scattered across the world? The case of General Walker shows that
the Army at least is not fertile enough ground for a far-right regime to go a
very long way, for the size, reasons of size, and disposition."</p>

<p>Then there is an insert I have difficulty in reading.</p>

<p>"Which service, then, can qualify to launch a coup in the U.S.A.? Small size,
a permanent hard core of officers and few bases as necessary. Only one outfit
fits that description, and the U.S. Marine Corps is a rightwing-infiltrated organization
of dire potential consequences to the freedom of the United States. I
agree with former President Truman when he said that 'The Marine Corps
should be abolished.'"</p>

<p>That indicates some of his thinking.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will just take a short break.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 106 for identification is a notebook.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is my book, some poems <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. It contains handwriting in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you happen to write that, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I simply liked these verses. I did not have a book of poems.
And I made a copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 106.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 106, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 107 contains a small piece of cardboard with some
writing in Russian on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is Lee's pass from the factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 107.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 107, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 108 is an original one sheet of paper, with handwriting
in ink, in Russian, on one page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are the lyrics of a popular song.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. A Russian popular song?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This is Armenian&mdash;an Armenian popular song.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 108.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It is admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 108, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 109 is one sheet with handwriting in ink on both sides,
an original.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was simply my recollection of some song lyrics and the
names of some songs that people had asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer Exhibit 109.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 109, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 110 is a yellow legal sized sheet with handwriting in
Russian which seems to be interpreted in English below it, together with a
little stamp. I can explain the stamp. It says FBI Laboratory.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is when George Bouhe was giving me lessons. I translated
from Russian into English&mdash;not very successfully&mdash;my first lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer Exhibit 110.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 110, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was it that George Bouhe was teaching you English and
you wrote this out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was in July 1962. I don't remember when I arrived&mdash;in
'62 or '61.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is the handwriting in Exhibit 110 in the Russian as well as
the English in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. The Russian is written by Bouhe, and the English is
written by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you make the translation from the Russian into the English
by yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I had to study English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a dictionary to work with?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So you were taking a Russian-English dictionary and trying to
convert the Russian words that he wrote out into English, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 111 is a book written in Russian, a pocket book.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is my book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you notice some of the letters are cut out of that book,
Exhibit 111?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Letters?</p>

<p>I see that for the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know who did that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Probably Lee was working, but I never saw that. I don't know
what he did that for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You never saw him while he was working with that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I would have shown him if I had seen him doing that to
my book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You know sometimes messages are made up by cutting out
letters that way and putting them together to make words.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I read about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have never seen him do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer Exhibit 111.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 111, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 112 is an apparent application&mdash;an applicant's driving
record.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never seen this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. It is in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is not your driving record, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know whether it was your husband's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. May I clarify the exhibit? It is an application for a Texas
driver's license. Standard form application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 112.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 112, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is quite possible that Lee prepared that, because Ruth Paine
insisted on Lee's obtaining a license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you hear her insist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. She said it would be good to have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. October or November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. '63.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 113 is a driver's handbook published by the State of
Texas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We had this book for quite some time. George Bouhe had
given that to Lee if he at some time would try to learn how to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 113.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 113, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was your husband able to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I think that he knew how. Ruth taught him how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have a driver's license that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>This is a Russian camera of Lee's&mdash;binoculars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 114 is a leather case containing a pair of binoculars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember having seen those binoculars, known as Exhibit
114, before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. We had binoculars in Russia because we liked to look
through them at a park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether your husband used them in connection
with the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He never said anything about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 114.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 114, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 115 is a box containing a stamping kit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is Lee's. When he was busy with his Cuba, he used it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean when he was working on the Fair Play for Cuba, he
used this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 115.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 115, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he use that kit in Exhibit 115 in connection with his
Fair Play for Cuba campaign?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had leaflets for which he assembled letters and printed his
address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And he used this kit largely to stamp the address on the letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not letters, but leaflets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He stamped the address on the leaflets?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Handbills, rather.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall whether he stamped his name on the handbills, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What name did he stamp on them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he use the name Hidell on those, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember. Perhaps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 116 is a Spanish to English and English to Spanish
dictionary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you seen that before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When Lee came from Mexico City I think he had this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 116.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be received.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 116, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 117 is one sheet of paper with, some penciled markings
on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what that is. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize any of the writing on that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 117.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 117, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 118 is a clipping from a newspaper. There are some
notations on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall seeing that clipping, Exhibit 118, before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize any of the handwriting on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As far as it is visible, it is similar to Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer Exhibit 118.
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. 118 may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 118, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I call attention to the members of the Commission that Exhibit
118 has a reference to the President, with regard to the income tax, and the
position of the Administration as being favorable to business rather than to the
small taxpayer in the approach to the income tax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 119 contains a key with a chain.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what this is a key to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It appears to be a key to a padlock. Do you recognize it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can see that it is a key to a padlock, but I have never used
such a key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever seen your husband use such a key?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is hard to remember what key he used. I know he had a key.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 119 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 120 purports to be a telescope&mdash;15 power telescope.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never seen such a telescope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You never saw it as a part of your husband's things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked for identification as Exhibit No. 120.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 121 is a Russell Stover candy box filled with miscellaneous
assortment&mdash;medicines of all kinds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, can you help us in regard to that Exhibit 121?
Are those your medicines or are those your husband's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are all my medications.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 121 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 122 is a cardboard box containing an assortment of
items.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are all his things. I think he used this to clean the
rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are showing us pipe cleaners that you say your husband
used to clean the rifle, as you remember it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How often did he clean it, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not too often. I have already told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 122.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be received.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 122, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 123 contains seven small one ounce dark brown bottles.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's brother is a pharmacist. He gave this to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. As well as the apparent boxes that they came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Which brother is a pharmacist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean his cousin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. In the Russian the word cousin is second brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 123.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be received.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 123, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 124 is a hunting knife in a sheath, approximately a
4- or 5-inch blade.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never seen this knife.</p>

<p>It is a new knife. And that telescope is also new.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 124 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 125 is a file cabinet for presumably three by five or five
by seven inch cards.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee kept his printing things in that, pencils.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The things that he printed his Fair Play for Cuba leaflets on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Pencils and materials that he used in connection with that
matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have any index cards in that metal case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he had some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know what happened to them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what was on those index cards?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. A list of any people that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were those leaflets about Fair Play for Cuba printed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then did he stamp something on them after he had them
printed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He would print his name and address on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will offer in evidence Exhibit 125.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 125, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know what happened to the cards that were in that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 126 is a small hand overnight bag, canvas zipper bag.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is Lee's handbag, and he arrived with it from Mexico
City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It is one of the bags that you described when you were telling
about his bringing one back from Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He only had this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 126 was the only bag that he brought back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 126.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 126, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 127 is a suitcase.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A Russian suitcase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have seen that before, have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he took Exhibit 127 to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know, or you don't think he did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know that he did not take it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know when he used Exhibit 127?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't think that he would have used it.</p>

<p>Was this taken in Lee's apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We cannot tell you that, Mrs. Oswald. We don't know which
place it was taken from.</p>

<p>You have seen it amongst his things, though, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I think these things were in Ruth Paine's garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know whether it is his or Mrs. Paine's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is my suitcase.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you use it to come from the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This is not Lee's suitcase, then&mdash;this is your personal suitcase?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Ours, or mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 127.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you need that? That is hers. She may want it. Do you
think we need it?</p>

<p>Very well. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 127, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 128 is a Humble Oil and Refining Company courtesy
map of the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I call your attention, Mrs. Oswald, to the markings in ink, in
the area where the assassination took place.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This map Lee acquired after returning to Irving. Before that,
he had another map.</p>

<p>That doesn't tell me anything. I did not use this map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see your husband use it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I think that this was in his apartment, where he lived.
Perhaps he used it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see him put those markings on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I have never seen him use this specific map. Possibly he
marked this place, not because of what happened there, but because this was
the place where he worked, I don't know. He had a habit to note down the
addresses of all acquaintances where he worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell whether the writing on the side of the map there
is in your husband's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It doesn't look like his handwriting.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 128.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 129 purports to be some type of an official document in
Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is my birth certificate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why it was issued at that date, rather than presumably
the one that was issued when you were born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because mine was lost somewhere, and it was reissued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have to go there to get it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, simply write a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And they mailed it to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer that exhibit in evidence.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 129, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 130 seems to be an original instrument in Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a copy of a birth certificate which a notary issues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Whose certificate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 130.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 130, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 131 is a one-sheet document in Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why did you have these other copies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These documents were needed for regularizing all the documents
in connection with the trip abroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know why the date was rewritten from July 14 to July 19
on them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In which?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In the original.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't see that.</p>

<p>It says July 17, 1941.   The certificate is issued July 19, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. The transcript shows 17th of July 1941.</p>

<p>May I explain it, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You explain it, Mr. Krimer, and then ask her if you are explaining
it correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. I have explained it correctly, and she says it is correct.</p>

<p>This states she was born on July 17, but that an entry was made in the register
about that on August 14, 1961. This accounts for the change in the digit. And
this was issued on July 19, 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer that in evidence.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 131, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. 132 is a two-sheet, eight-page letter with an envelope. This is
written in Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The envelope is from Sobolev, and the letter is from Golovachev.
I simply kept them together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. There is a reference in the last full paragraph of that letter,
Mrs. Oswald, where it said, "By the way, Marina, try to explain to Paul that the
basic idea of Pagodzin's play 'A man with a rifle' is contained in words"&mdash;and
then goes on. Do you know what was meant by that?</p>

<p>It says "Now we do not have to fear a man with a rifle." Who is Paul?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is only that the word "rifle" scares you, but it is quite harmless.
This is Peter Gregory, Paul. He is also studying Russian. And he had
to make a report at the institute about Pagodzin's play "Man with a Rifle". This
play is about the revolution in Russia, and there is a film. I helped him with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are satisfied that has nothing to do with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 132.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 132, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 133 contains two photographs.</p>

<p>These are pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald with a rifle and pistol.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For me at first they appeared to be one and the same, at first
glance. But they are different poses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You took both of those pictures, did you, in Exhibit 133?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And are those the pictures you took when you were out hanging
up diapers, and your husband asked you to take the pictures of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. With the pistol and the rifle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 133.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibit No. 133, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall whether these pictures in Exhibit 133 were taken
before or after the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 134 is an enlargement of one of these pictures&mdash;what
purports to be an enlargement.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, this is an enlargement of that photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, in Exhibit 133, in one of the pictures your husband
has a newspaper, it appears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think in both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I want to correct that.</p>

<p>In both he appears to have a newspaper. In one of them he has the newspaper
in the right hand and in the other in the left hand. Do you know what newspaper
that is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It says there "Militant." But I don't know what kind of a
paper that is&mdash;whether it is Communist, anti-Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall how much earlier than the Walker incident you
took these photographs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About two weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was the enlargement of one of those pictures, Exhibit 134, made
by you, or by someone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know who made the enlargement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you seen Exhibit 134, the enlargement, before this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I have been shown an enlargement, but I don't know
whether this is the one I have been shown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who showed that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Apart from Mr. Gopadze, somebody else showed me an enlargement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Does this appear to be like the enlargement that you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I think it was specially enlarged for the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit No. 134.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 134, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit No. 136 purports to be a clipping from a newspaper.
It is a clipping of an advertisement, a mail coupon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 135.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 135, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I call the Commission's attention to the fact that this is the
coupon under which it appears the rifle was ordered, showing an enclosed $10
notation&mdash;"Check for $29.95, A.&nbsp;G. Hidell, age 28, post office box 2915, Dallas,
Texas."</p>

<p>And it is marked, "One&mdash;quantity. Point 38 ST. W. 2 inch barrel, 29.95," and
underlined is 29.95, and an arrow at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 136 is a camera contained within a leather case.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a Russian camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that the camera you used to take the pictures you have
referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember exactly whether it was an American camera
or this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But this was one of your cameras, or your husband's cameras?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My husband's camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 136.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 136, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 137 is a camera in a leather case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever seen that camera before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that a Russian camera?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 137 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 138 is a flash attachment for some type of camera. It
is an Ansco flash attachment.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never seen it.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 138 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what happened to the American camera that you
referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this Ansco flash equipment an attachment for that camera?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never seen it. It seems to me that it is new.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the fateful rifle of Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that the scope that it had on it, as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 139.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 139, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 140 apparently is a blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you seen that before, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is still from Russia. June loved to play with that blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that the blanket that your husband used to cover up the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. We didn't use this blanket as a cover. He used it for the
rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And it was the blanket that you saw and thought was covering
the rifle in the garage at the Paine's, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he use it as a cover for the rifle at other places where you
lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 140.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 140, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say that June played with this blanket, Exhibit 140?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I would put that on the floor to make it softer&mdash;on a
balcony, for example, when June was playing on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that in this country or in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She didn't crawl yet in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What balcony was that&mdash;what house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Neely Street, in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 141 is an envelope that contains a bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever seen bullets or shells like that that your husband
had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think Lee's were smaller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If that was the size for his gun, would that cause you to think
it was the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you see his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In New Orleans, and on Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In the box, or laying loose some place?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In a box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 141.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 141, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 142 is some kraft paper, brown wrapping paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It wasn't brown before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see that before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The FBI questioned me about this paper, but I don't know&mdash;I
have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At one time it was kraft color, before they treated it to get
fingerprints.</p>

<p>Did you ever see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Everybody sees such paper. But I didn't see that with Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have never seen anything like that around the house, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. We have wrapping paper around the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That Exhibit 142 is more than just wrapping paper. It was
apparently made up into a sack or bag.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see him make up a bag or sack or anything like
that, to hold a rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 142, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 143 is a pistol.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You recognize that as a pistol of your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 143.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 143, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 144 is a leather pistol holster.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a holster for Lee's pistol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is Exhibit 144 the same holster that is in those pictures that
you took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the pistol is the same pistol as in those pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As much as I can tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At least they appear to be, as far as you can tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the rifle is the same, or appears to be, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 144, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Exhibit 145 is a small cardboard box containing two bullets,
.38 caliber.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize those as appearing to be the size of the
bullets that your husband had for the pistol?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is hard for me to tell, because I don't understand about this.
I never looked at them, because I am afraid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you have seen bullets like that, have you, in your husband's
apartment or rooming house, or in the Neely apartment or at Mrs. Paine's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Mrs. Paine's I never saw any shells.</p>

<p>On Neely Street, perhaps it is similar&mdash;New Orleans. It looks like it. If
they fit Lee's pistol, then they must be the right ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 145.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Admitted.</p>

<p>(The article referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 145, and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will take a short recess.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will be in order, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, would you step over with the interpreter to this
desk and point out the different pieces of clothing as we ask you about it, please?</p>

<p>Do you know the shirt that Lee Oswald wore the morning that he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember. What else interests you? What do you
want?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us whether any of this clothing set out on this desk
belonged to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are Lee's shoes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you say the shoes, you pointed to Exhibit 149?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is a pair of shoes of which Exhibit 149 is a photograph.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are his bath slippers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 148 are his bath slippers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Japanese bath slippers. These shoes I have never seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 147, you say those are shoes you have never
seen?</p>

<p>How about Exhibit 146?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are his, yes. These are all Lee's shirts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibits 150, <span class="locked">151&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are his pajamas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibits 150, and 151 are Lee Oswald's shirts, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And Exhibit 152 is a pair of his pajamas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And Exhibit 153&mdash;you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is his shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And Exhibit 154? Is that one of his shirts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 155?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, also. Why is it all torn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We are advised it was when he was hurt, they cut into some
of these.</p>

<p>Do you recall whether or not he was wearing Exhibit&mdash;the shirt that I point
to now, the morning of the 22d of November&mdash;Exhibit 150?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was a dark shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that was the one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I call your attention to Exhibit 156. Is that a pair of his pants?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. These are his work pants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And 157?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Also work pants. These are all work pants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 158?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Why were both of those cut? I don't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I have not been informed, but I will try to find out for you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is not necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall which of the pants he was wearing on the morning
of November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think the gray ones, but I am not sure, because it was dark
in the room, and I paid no attention to what pants he put on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By the gray ones, you are referring to what I point to as Exhibit
157, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us about Exhibit 159, a sweater?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was my gift to Lee, a sweater.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 160?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is Lee's shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 161?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a pullover sweater. This is his pullover sweater.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 162?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is Lee's&mdash;an old shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Sort of a jacket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 163?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall which one of the sweaters or jackets he was
wearing on the morning of November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was the last time that you saw this jacket, Exhibit 163?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember seeing it on the morning of November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The thing is that I saw Lee in the room, and I didn't see him
getting dressed in the room. That is why it is difficult for me to say. But I
told him to put on something warm on the way to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall whether the jacket, Exhibit 163, is something
that he put on in your presence at any time that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you didn't observe it on him at any time, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is it possible that Exhibit 163 was worn by him that morning
without your knowing about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Quite possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, at the time you saw him at the Dallas jail, can you tell
us what clothing of any that are on this desk he was wearing at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None of these. He had on a white T-shirt. What trousers he
was wearing, I could not tell, because I only saw him through a window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you examine the collar on the shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is Lee's shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It has a mark "Brent long tail sanforized."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I know this shirt. I gave it to him. The sweater is also
his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any of these clothes that your husband was wearing
when he came home Thursday night, November 21, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Thursday I think he wore this shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that Exhibit 150?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember anything else he was wearing at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It seems he had that jacket, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 162?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the pants, Exhibit 157?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. But I am not sure. This is as much as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. I identify this photograph, which is marked Exhibit 164 as
being a true photograph of the shirt displayed to Mrs. Oswald, and recognized
by her as being a shirt that she gave to Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer all of the Exhibits, Nos. 146 to 164, inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The articles referred to were marked Commission Exhibit Nos. 146 to 164,
inclusive, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you remember any information or documents
under your control or in your possession which would relate to or shed any light
on the matters we have been examining which you have not presented here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have nothing else. Everything has been taken from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Some of the Commissioners have a question or two, or a few
questions. If you will permit them, they would like to address them to you.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mrs. Oswald, this question has already been asked
you, but I would like to ask it again.</p>

<p>I gather that you have reached the conclusion in your own mind that your
husband killed President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Regretfully, yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. During the weeks and months prior to the assassination&mdash;and
I think this question has also been asked&mdash;did you ever at any time
hear your late husband express any hostility towards President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What motive would you ascribe to your husband in
killing President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As I saw the documents that were being read to me, I came to
the conclusion that he wanted in any&mdash;by any means, good or bad, to get into
history. But now that I have heard a part of the translation of some of the
documents, I think that there was some political foundation to it, a foundation
of which I am not aware.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. By that, do you mean that your husband acted in
concert with someone else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, only alone.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You are convinced that his action was his action alone,
that he was influenced by no one else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I am convinced.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you consider your husband a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He told me when we were in New Orleans that he was a
Communist, but I didn't believe him, because I said, "What kind of a Communist
are you if you don't like the Communists in Russia?"</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he like the Communists in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He considered them to be on a higher level and more conscious
than the Communists in Russia.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you consider your husband a normal man in the
usual sense of the term?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was always a normal man, but where it concerned his ideas,
and he did not introduce me to his ideas, I did not consider him normal.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Maybe I used the wrong terminology. Did you consider
him mentally sound?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes; he was smart and capable. Only he did not use his capabilities
in the proper direction. He was not deprived of reason&mdash;he was not a
man deprived of reason.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Senator Cooper, did you have any questions to ask?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No one knows the truth, no one can read someone else's
thoughts, as I could not read Lee's thoughts. But that is only my opinion.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Mrs. Oswald, some of the questions that I ask you you may
have answered&mdash;because I have been out at times.</p>

<p>I believe you have stated that your husband at times expressed opposition to
or dislike of the United States or of its political or economic system, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As far as I know, he expressed more dissatisfaction with
economic policy, because as to the political matters he did not enlighten me as to
his political thoughts.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever suggest to you or to anyone in your presence
that the economic system of the United States should be changed, and did he
suggest any means for changing it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He never proposed that, but from his conversations it followed
that it would be necessary to change it. But he didn't propose any methods.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever say to you or anyone in your presence that
the system might be changed if officials were changed or authorities of our
country were changed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he never said that to me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did he ever express to you any hostility towards any particular
official of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know that he didn't like Walker, but I don't know whether
you could call him an official.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask if you ever heard anyone express to him hostility
towards President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. More specifically, I will ask&mdash;did you know Mr. Frazier?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Wesley Frazier.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes, that is the boy who took him to work.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You never heard him or anyone else express to your husband
any hostility towards President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. That is all I have.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Dulles, have you anything further you would like to ask?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I only have one question. Mr. Rankin has
kindly asked several questions I had during the course of this hearing, these
hearings the last 3 days.</p>

<p>Apart from trying to achieve a place in history, can you think of any other
motive or anything that your husband felt he would achieve by the act of
assassinating the President? That he was trying to accomplish something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is hard for me to say what he wanted to accomplish, because
I don't understand him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Congressman Ford, did you have anything further?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mrs. Oswald after President Kennedy was assassinated,
your husband was apprehended and later questioned by a number of authorities.
In the questioning he denied that he kept a rifle at Mrs. Paine's home. He denied
shooting President Kennedy. And he questioned the authenticity of the
photographs that you took of him holding the rifle and the holster.</p>

<p>Now, despite these denials by your husband, you still believe Lee Oswald
killed President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mr. Chairman, just one or two other questions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mrs. Oswald, when you lived in New Orleans with your
husband, and he was active in this alleged Cuban committee, did you attend any
meetings of any committees&mdash;was anyone else present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, never.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Were there any members of the committee other than
your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was no one. There was no one. There was no organization
in New Orleans. Only Lee was there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. One other question. Did he also dislike Russia when
he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mrs. Oswald, you have been a very cooperative witness.
You have helped the Commission. We are grateful to you for doing this. We
realize that this has been a hard ordeal for you to go through.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was difficult to speak all the truth.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We hope you know that the questions we have asked you
have&mdash;none of them have been from curiosity or to embarrass you, but only to
report to the world what the truth is.</p>

<p>Now, after you leave here, you may have a copy of everything you have testified
to. You may read it, and if there is anything that you think was not correctly
recorded, or anything you would like to add to it, you may do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I unfortunately&mdash;I cannot&mdash;since it will be in English.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Your lawyer may read it for you, and if he points out something
to you that you think you should have changed, you may feel free to do that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he will read it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And if in the future we should like to ask you some more questions
about something that develops through the investigation, would you be
willing to come back and talk to us again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We hope it won't be necessary to disturb you. But if it is,
you would be willing to come, would you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Chairman&mdash;I would just like to suggest that if
Mrs. Oswald does wish to revise any of her testimony, that this be called to the
attention of the Commission through her attorney, Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, of course. That is the proper procedure.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Thorne, you have been very cooperative with the Commission. We
appreciate that cooperation. We hope that if anything new should come to your
attention that would be helpful to the Commission, you would feel free to communicate
with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Certainly, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you care to say anything at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Mr. Chairman, if I may, I would like to make a closing statement.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. And may I say, also, if you have any questions you
would like to ask Mrs. Oswald before you make your statement, you may do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. There are none.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say Mr. Thorne
has been very helpful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. During the noon recess, Mrs. Oswald made four requests of me
to make before this Commission.</p>

<p>You have anticipated several of them, but I think there are one or two that
need to be covered.</p>

<p>To begin with, she wanted me to express to you, Mr. Chairman, and members
of your Commission, her extreme gratitude to you for the consideration and
kindness that has been shown to her in these proceedings. She feels you have
certainly gone out of your way to make her comfortable, and she has been comfortable,
in spite of the sad and tragic events we have been discussing.</p>

<p>Point No. 2, she did want to make it quite clear to the Commission that in
the event her testimony was needed for rebuttal or whatever on down the line,
she would be available, and at your wish would come to Washington as convenient
for you when it was again convenient.</p>

<p>The third point you have already covered. She did request that she be given
a copy of these proceedings, which I told her she would receive, and, of course,
copies of the exhibits would be attached for her identification and examination.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And copies of some of the letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. This will all be attached as exhibits.</p>

<p>And the final point was this. She has been, as you know, under protective
custody of the Secret Service from shortly after the assassination. She has
been most grateful for this protection. The Secret Service have shown her
every courtesy, as everyone has in this matter. She is extremely grateful for
this protection they have given her.</p>

<p>I haven't had personally enough time to think this thing out myself. I don't
know. It is her request, however, that, at this point she feels the protection is
no longer necessary. She feels that at this time she can walk among people
with her head held high. She has nothing to hide. She is not afraid.</p>

<p>She feels that the Secret Service has performed a noble service to her. And
this is not meant by way of saying for some action on their part she wants
to get rid of them.</p>

<p>I have noticed that since we have been in Washington she resents being guided.
She feels she can find her way by herself.</p>

<p>And, if the Commission would give this matter consideration&mdash;we don't know
whom to go to. I haven't thought about it. I don't know who has suggested
the Secret Service continue protecting her. It is a matter, of course, that ought
to be considered.</p>

<p>But it is her request that as soon as it is practical, she would like to be a free
agent and out of the confines of this protection.</p>

<p>I point out to you gentlemen that she is living, as you well know, with Mr. and
Mrs. Martin. They have a rather modest home. Three bedrooms. It has a
den and it has a combination living and dining room. The house is not extremely
large, but there are always two men in the house. This does burden
the family. This is not a request on the part of the Martins. They welcome
this protection. This is something she thinks in terms of herself that she does
not want to feel that she is being held back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What I wanted to say, Mr. Thorne has said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. For my own part, gentlemen, thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Thorne, we can understand Mrs. Oswald's desire to live
a perfectly normal life with her children. Whatever has been done, as you
recognize, has been done for her protection, and for her help during these terrible
days that she has been going through.</p>

<p>But she may feel from this moment on that she is under no protection, except
what she might ask for. And so you are perfectly free, Mrs. Oswald, to live
your normal life without any interference from anyone. And should anyone
interfere with you, I hope you would call it to the attention of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I add one point, please?</p>

<p>For our purposes, I would appreciate it if this matter of removal, assuming
that it is to be removed shortly, is kept secret, also.</p>

<p>I would prefer generally for the public to feel that&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;that
this protection is available. I don't feel any qualms myself. I don't feel
there are any problems. But I think the matter of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald has
come up. There may be some problem from some sources.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Thorne, I think the correct answer to that would be&mdash;and
it would be the answer we would give&mdash;that Mrs. Oswald, in the future, will be
given such assistance and only such assistance as she asks for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I want to say also before the session adjourns that we are
indebted to Mr. Krimer for the manner in which he has interpreted. Next to
the witness, I am sure he has had the hardest position in this whole hearing.
And we appreciate the manner in which he has done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krimer</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He is a very good interpreter.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well. If there is nothing further to come before the
session, we will adjourn.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am very grateful to all of you. I didn't think among Americans
I would find so many friends.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You have friends here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:50 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARGUERITE OSWALD</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10 a.m. on February 10, 1964, at 200
Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman: Senator Richard B.
Russell, Representative Hale Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and Allen W.
Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel; John F. Doyle, attorney for Mrs. Marguerite Oswald; and Leon
Jaworski, special counsel to the attorney general of Texas.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Let the record show that Senator Russell and I are present, and we convened
today for the purpose of taking the testimony of Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald, would you rise and be sworn, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God, throughout this proceeding?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do&mdash;so help me God.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be seated.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Oswald, you are here represented by an attorney, are you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; Mr. Doyle is representing me.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Doyle is representing you. Mr. Doyle was appointed,
was he not, at your request?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I asked to be represented by counsel.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. And the record may show that Mr. Doyle was appointed
to represent her at the request of Mrs. Oswald by the president of the Bar
Association of the District of Columbia, Mr. Pratt.</p>

<p>That is correct, is it not, Mr. Doyle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. It is, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you are appearing voluntarily before the Commission,
are you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, voluntarily.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You requested to do so.</p>

<p>In order that you may have a full opportunity to testify in your own manner,
and tell us everything that you know, and particularly because we do not know
what you know, I am going to ask you if you would like first, in your own
way, and in your own time, to tell us everything you have concerning this case.</p>

<p>You would like to do that, would you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Chief Justice Warren. I would like to very much.</p>

<p>However, there are three things that I have asked that should be brought
before the Council, three requests of mine. One has already been granted&mdash;that
is the counsel, Mr. Doyle. And I do appreciate that fact.</p>

<p>I have stated publicly that I believe in the American way of life and justice
for all men, which is our American way of life.</p>

<p>My son, Lee Harvey Oswald, was tried and convicted within a few hours
time, without benefit of counsel. And so I am appealing to the Board that my
son, Lee Harvey Oswald, be represented by counsel. I am being represented
by counsel. My daughter-in-law Marina was represented by counsel. And I
understand that all other witnesses will have the privilege of being represented
by counsel.</p>

<p>However, the main object of the Commission is Lee Harvey Oswald, in the
murder of President Kennedy. So I strongly believe that Lee should be represented
by counsel.</p>

<p>Now, my reasons for wanting this done this way is, I will state, that Marina
has testified. Marina has testified, according to the papers&mdash;and I am assuming
that this is correct&mdash;that Lee wanted to live in Russia and Cuba, and that is
why he went to Mexico.</p>

<p>I happen to know differently&mdash;because Marina has told me the first day I
was with her, "Mama, I write to Russian consul. I want go back to Russia. I
like America. But Lee no get work."</p>

<p>So you see, had a counsel been there in behalf of my son, when Marina said
that&mdash;it doesn't have to be a court trial or a cross-examination. All I am asking
is that this man sit quietly, and when he knows of different facts, then he
could say, "Well, Mrs. Oswald, isn't it true that you wrote the Russian consul
yourself, wanting to go back to Russia?"</p>

<p>And in this way, gentlemen, I believe you would have both sides and a true
picture.</p>

<p>I cannot see how you can come to a true conclusion by taking individual
testimony.</p>

<p>Now, I, myself, am here today to testify. I have been sworn in. But that
doesn't mean that I can tell the whole story. I may forget something. And
the counsel would know.</p>

<p>We have investigators all over the country, the reporters are interested, the
public. I have over 1,500 letters, people expressing their opinion of the way
this case is being handled. And, believe me, gentlemen, they are not satisfied.</p>

<p>I can produce these documents for you.</p>

<p>They think, like I think, that the American way of life, both sides should be
heard.</p>

<p>I don't think that seven men of this Commission can come to a true conclusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
What it will be, it will be an analysis of what the FBI and the Secret Service
and the Dallas police have&mdash;mainly, speculation and opinion of other people.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Lane has affidavits, I understand, from the same witnesses that have
made statements to the Dallas police, which are contrary to those particular
statements.</p>

<p>I implore you&mdash;I implore you, in the name of justice, to let my son, Lee Harvey
Oswald, who is accused of assassinating the President, and I, the mother of this
man, who is the accused's mother, be represented by counsel.</p>

<p>We have information pertinent to this case.</p>

<p>My daughter-in-law is the only one who has testified.</p>

<p>The things that came out in the paper&mdash;I know, I have documents. I am not
asking you to believe me as a mother. I can prove the statements that I say.</p>

<p>And I believe in this way you will have a true picture, and a much better
picture, because as you are going along you will be having both sides, and won't
have to wait to analyze the situation in the end, as the testimony is being given
by each individual, right then and there&mdash;you will have the other party's
testimony.</p>

<p>Now, there is <span class="locked">another&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Before you leave that, Mrs. Oswald, may I say to you, first,
that the Commission is not here to prosecute your dead son. It is not here and
it was not established to prosecute anyone.</p>

<p>It is the purpose and the province of the Commission to obtain all the facts
that it can obtain, and then make an impartial report&mdash;not as a prosecutor, but
as an impartial Commission&mdash;on the manner in which the President came to his
death.</p>

<p>We are trying to recognize the individual rights of all persons who are called
before the Commission, to let them have their lawyers, and let their lawyers
have an opportunity to examine them, as well as the Commission.</p>

<p>You may be sure that if Mr. Lane has any evidence of his own knowledge,
or has any accumulation of affidavits from others, to the effect&mdash;to any effect,
concerning this trial, that he will have an opportunity to come here, just as you
are here, in order to present those to the Commission.</p>

<p>But so far as his being here at all times before the Commission to cross-examine
or to be present when all witnesses are testifying&mdash;that is not in accordance with
the procedures of the Commission.</p>

<p>But I assure you that if Mr. Lane has any evidence of any kind bearing upon
the assassination of the President, he will be accorded the same opportunity
that you have to come here and present them, and we will give him an opportunity
in his own way to tell his story, and present his own evidence. And should
he want counsel, he may have counsel, also.</p>

<p>Now, you may go to your second point.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I am not finished with my first, please.</p>

<p>I appreciate and I understand exactly what you have told me, Chief Justice
Warren.</p>

<p>But there is one thing&mdash;and, of course, I will have to accept your decision, and
will be most happy to have Mr. Lane present his testimony the way you have
suggested.</p>

<p>However, I am not in agreement with you. One point I want to make clear.</p>

<p>We do not know the questions that you are asking of myself or Marina or the
other witnesses. And I contend that you cannot ask them the pertinent questions
because you don't know what I know, and what Mr. Lane knows. And
so you will still have an analysis in the long run, a conclusion.</p>

<p>I am going to go back to Marina. As I say, Marina made her <span class="locked">statements&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. On that particular thing, may I say this: It is true that we
don't know how to examine you at the present time because we don't know what
you have to present to this Commission. But we are affording you the opportunity
before we ask you any questions to tell your story, in your own way.</p>

<p>Then we should know what questions we want to ask of you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I understand that thoroughly.</p>

<p>But I am a human being, going through a life story from childhood, and I may
forget something that my counsel would know. And that applies to witnesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
They may forget to testify something that my counsel has facts on. I will have
to accept your verdict, but I don't do it graciously.</p>

<p>I want that for record.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. Well, that is all right, Mrs. Oswald. You may state
that for the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have documents, and I would like to ask, please&mdash;I will not
leave any documents out of my hand. I carry them with me wherever I go. Even
Mr. Doyle has been told that the documents stay with me.</p>

<p>I have had documents stolen from me. I have had newspaper clippings stolen
from me in my home, by the Secret Service.</p>

<p>I make the statement perfectly plain. And so the documents stay with me.</p>

<p>Now, these are originals. I want, and you will want, copies of every original
I have, and I will be more than happy to let you have them. However, I want
to be present when these copies are made and the original returned to me.</p>

<p>I will under no circumstances let anyone have my originals for an hour or two,
and then return them to me&mdash;if I am making myself plain.</p>

<p>I would like to request that, please.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will accommodate you in that respect.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then I have one other stipulation or request.</p>

<p>When I tell my story, I will be including people in my story that possibly
you don't know of. I request that I have the privilege, through you, of course,
to subpena these people that are in connection with the story that I tell, if
you do not have the names already.</p>

<p>And I feel sure that I have some information that you don't know about,
and there are some people involved.</p>

<p>I also request that after my testimony, that Marina Oswald will be subpenaed&mdash;not
subpenaed but will then testify again, if you see fit. And I believe
that I have contrary testimony to her testimony that would make it necessary
for her to be recalled.</p>

<p>I ask that that be granted.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mrs. Oswald, of course you have no power of subpena,
and we have no power to give you the power of subpena. But you may be
sure that if your evidence produces anything that is critical to this investigation,
that we will pursue it to the end, in order to determine the weight of the
testimony for our final report. You may be sure of that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I appreciate that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. But as to how we do it, or when we do it, you will just
have to leave that to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You will give me the assurance that these people I name,
regardless of title&mdash;I am liable to name some very important <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. No, we cannot give you any assurance, because we don't
<span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I see no reason, then, for my testimony.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mrs. Oswald&mdash;you cannot commit us to subpenaing
anybody. We don't know. You are talking to us, and we are in the dark.
You cannot commit this Commission to doing something that might be improper,
it might not even be helpful in any way, shape, or form. The Commission
will be reasonable in every respect. We have no desire to protect anyone.
We have no desire to injure you or anyone else in this matter. And certainly
you ought to have some confidence in a commission that is appointed by the
President, and not try to tie our hands in a way that would be contrary to
the manner in which commissions normally proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, Mr. Warren, you made a statement that you in no way&mdash;I
cannot quote your words&mdash;intimidate me. But you did not include my son.
My son is being accused of the murder of President Kennedy. And I think
that my son should be considered in this. He is dead. But we can show cause
that my son is not the assassin of President Kennedy. And so I would like
my son&mdash;he is the main object of the Presidential Commission, is he not, sir?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. No, no, he is not, Mrs. Oswald. The purpose of this Commission
is to determine what the facts are in the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
It is not an accusation against your son. There was an accusation against
your son in the Texas courts. That is an entirely different proceeding.</p>

<p>We are here to do justice and be fair to everyone concerned in this matter.
And I assure you that that is our main and our only purpose in serving on
this Commission. None of us cherish this responsibility.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sure, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And the only satisfaction we can derive from it is to be
fair to all concerned.</p>

<p>And I assure you that is our objective in the matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not mean to imply that this Commission will not be fair.
I know about the men on the Commission. And they are all very fine men, including
yourself, Chief Justice Warren. If I have implied that, I will&mdash;will now
say I do not imply. But I do state a fact that I do not think that you can come
to a true conclusion. I want that for record.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to produce&mdash;and this will be a fact&mdash;and this is on the
<span class="locked">basis&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Now, we have finished the three things that you are talking
about, and we are going to your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is in connection with this, Chief Justice Warren. And
I think it is very important to present a picture.</p>

<p>And then if you allow me these few minutes, I will be through.</p>

<p>Is that satisfactory, sir?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I believe you mentioned that you would not have the
power or give me the power to subpena them. But if I could produce the facts
in my story, then I believe we should have these people called.</p>

<p>Now, here is an article in the Washington paper&mdash;and the date happens to
be torn off, but I can get it&mdash;that Senator John G. Tower had made. And I
have outlined <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I wonder, Mrs. Oswald&mdash;before we get into any details of
this kind, let's settle this situation as to whether the Commission will say
to you now that it will subpena anyone you ask.</p>

<p>I must say to you that you cannot put that burden on the Commission.
The Commission will have to exercise its own discretion as to who it subpenas
and when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, may I say something? I was wondering if
whether or not what Mrs. Oswald is addressing respectfully to the Commission
is her confidence that if in the course of her own testimony and the actual facts
that she is producing, she expresses confidence that if those facts recommend
the subpena of additional witnesses, or the recall of others, she expresses her
confidence that that would be done, if the facts she outlines so require.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. She may be very sure of that, as I tried to tell her.</p>

<p>But the only thing&mdash;I would not want Mrs. Oswald to leave here and say,
"I gave the Commission a list of witnesses and they did not call all of them."</p>

<p>Now, that is a matter that will have to be in the province of the Commission,
and not in the province of a witness.</p>

<p>And I say that without any combative&mdash;not in a combative spirit. Because,
as your counsel states, I think we are not far apart on it, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. And I appreciate the <span class="locked">fact&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. But fairness will have to judge our actions. And we propose
to be fair.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I guess I am a very stubborn person. I am a very aggressive
person, as you know by now.</p>

<p>I would like&mdash;this would be just 2 minutes, and it would bring a point, and
then I would be through, if I may.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Senator Towner has dates here, and the main part of the article
is that he had received a letter from the State Department.</p>

<p>Now, I would like&mdash;I have information from the State Department, I have
documents from the State Department which is contrary to the dates and contrary
to Senator Tower's public statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
And I would like to have the letter that he has from the State Department,
and the name of the man that wrote it, because it is contrary to what I have.</p>

<p>He could have been, to use an American slang, shooting his mouth off, because
he said if he went to Russia let him stay there, I would not help him&mdash;is what he
said.</p>

<p>But then again he may have this very important letter from this man in
the State Department, which is incorrect, from what I have.</p>

<p>Now, he claims&mdash;and if you would like to read that&mdash;and that is what I was
trying to bring out.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think you will have to leave that to the wisdom of the
Commission and its sense of fair play, and what is necessary, all facts considered.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I have had my say, gentlemen, and I will most graciously
continue.</p>

<p>However. I am not too happy that I will not have counsel for my son,
because I believe my son would also be entitled to counsel.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well, you may continue.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I will <span class="locked">start&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, may I introduce Congressman Ford, also a
member of the Commission.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Oswald&mdash;Mr. Lee Rankin will be in charge of the hearing from
this point on. He is our General Counsel, as you know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, will you proceed to produce the papers and tell us
about them, and then I will ask the Commission after we get them, to permit us
to substitute copies, and in accordance with your request we will let you be
present at the time we make the photostats.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may start to tell your story in your own way.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have three different stories. I understand from Mr. Rankin's
letter that my life is to be told from the very start, and so is Lee's life, from
the very start. So which will I start first?</p>

<p>I believe it would be easier for me and of more benefit to the counsel if I
would continue with one life, the whole story, and then continue with the&mdash;whichever
way you would suggest I do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If you could start out and tell us within the period that Lee
Oswald returned from the Soviet Union on, whatever you know about it, in
your own way, and then we will go back to the other matters later.</p>

<p>Is that all right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;anything is just fine. I am willing to help in any
way possible.</p>

<p>I wanted to state it clearly in the beginning.</p>

<p>I received a speedletter from the State Department stating that Lee would
leave Moscow, and how he would leave and arrive in New York&mdash;on June 13,
1962. I was on a case in Crowell, Tex. I am a practical nurse. And I was
taking care of a very elderly woman, whose daughter lived in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>So I was not able to leave and meet Lee.</p>

<p>Robert, his brother, met him, and Lee went to Robert's home.</p>

<p>Approximately about a week later&mdash;I could not stand it any more&mdash;I called the
daughter and had her come to take care of her mother, and took 3 days off,
and went to Fort Worth to see Lee and Marina.</p>

<p>Marina is a beautiful girl. And I said to Lee, "Marina, she doesn't look
Russian. She is beautiful."</p>

<p>He says, "Of course not. That is why I married her, because she looks like
an American girl."</p>

<p>I asked her where he had met her, and he said he met her at a social function,
a community function.</p>

<p>I said, "You know, Lee, I am getting ready&mdash;I was getting ready to write a
book on your so-called defection.</p>

<p>"I had researched it and came to Washington in 1961, and, by the way, asked
to see President Kennedy, because I had a lot of extenuating circumstances at
the time because of the defection."</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, you are not going to write a book."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
I said, "Lee, don't tell me what to do. I cannot write the book now, because,
Honey, you are alive and back."</p>

<p>But, at the time, I had no way of knowing whether my son was living or
dead, and I planned to write the book.</p>

<p>"But don't tell me what to do. It has nothing to do with you and Marina.
It is my life, because of your defection."</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, I tell you you are not to write the book. They could kill
her and her family."</p>

<p>That was in the presence of my son Robert Oswald and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us about what date that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Let's see. Lee arrived in New York on June 13, and&mdash;now, I
have a letter stating, from Lee, that he is arriving in New York on June 13th.
However, he plans to go to Washington for a day or two. So I have no way of
knowing, Mr. Rankin, whether he came straight from New York to my son's
home, or if he stayed in New York and came to Washington a few days.</p>

<p>But I have the letter stating that.</p>

<p>But I have no way of knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this conversation within about a week of the time that he
came back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, approximately. That is correct.</p>

<p>So I stayed in Fort Worth 2 or 3 days. I did not live at Robert's home. I
rented a motel. In fact, the lady of the mother I was taking care of paid my
motel expenses while I was in Fort Worth. But I went there every day.</p>

<p>While I was there&mdash;Marina is a pharmacist. I have a medical book, and Lee
was saying that he was losing his hair, and how he had become bald, because
of the cold weather in Texas.</p>

<p>So I got the medical book, looking up baldness, and the treatment for baldness,
and Marina came by and she read the prescriptions.</p>

<p>So I said, "Lee, she reads English," and he said, "Mother, that is Latin, of
course, that is universal."</p>

<p>So because it was a medical conversation, Lee said he had an operation while
in the Soviet Union on his throat.</p>

<p>I am sorry&mdash;but all of the confusion of myself being there and the daughter-in-law,
the Russian girl&mdash;that was never gone into. That is all I know.</p>

<p>But that was also said in the presence of my son Robert&mdash;that he had an
operation on his throat while in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say when that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that was all that was said.</p>

<p>As I say, with all the confusion of Marina, we were so thrilled with Marina,
with the children and all, there was quite a bit of confusion.</p>

<p>Now, I left, and I went back to Crowell on my job.</p>

<p>While I was in Robert's home, Lee immediately was out job-hunting. And I
felt very bad about that, because they had come 10,000 miles by ship, by plane,
and by train, which was an awfully hard trip with a young baby, and I thought
he should at least have a week or two before he would look for work.</p>

<p>But I want you to know that immediately Lee was out looking for work.</p>

<p>And this is the time that Lee had gone to the public stenographer, made the
statement that he was writing a book.</p>

<p>You probably have that information. It was highly publicized.</p>

<p>I, myself, gave him the $10 that he gave the public stenographer.</p>

<p>I bought Marina clothes, and brought clothes to her while at my daughter-in-law's
house, bought diapers for the baby. And Marina had more clothes when
she arrived in the States than I now have.</p>

<p>So what I am trying to state is as we go further into the story, it has been
stated that my son neglected Marina, and that she didn't have any clothes. The
Russian people have stated that all throughout Texas in the papers. And that
is not true. I happen to know, because I, myself, bought Marina three dresses.
And my daughter-in-law bought dresses, and my daughter-in-law's sister, which
I would like to have as a witness, bought clothes for Marina. So there is this
conflicting testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What daughter-in-law was that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Robert's wife. And Robert's wife's sister, who is a schoolteacher,
bought clothes for Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is she married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. She is a schoolteacher. She is single.</p>

<p>So that story there is incorrect.</p>

<p>So then I went back to Crowell, Tex., and I was not satisfied in my mind because
the way they lived. They only had a two-bedroom house. As you know.
Robert has two children. And there was another couple with another child.</p>

<p>So Lee immediately began looking for work.</p>

<p>So I decided that I would quit this job and help the children all I could. So
I did. I gave notice. And I came to Fort Worth, and I rented an apartment
at the Rotary Apartments, which is on West 7th and Summit. And Lee and
Marina then came to live with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did they stay at Robert's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They stayed at Robert's approximately 2 or 3 weeks, sir.</p>

<p>So then they came to live with me.</p>

<p>While there, I said to Lee&mdash;I am ahead of my story.</p>

<p>Lee and Marina had sent me wonderful gifts, and I have the gifts, from
Russia. A box of tea, very fine tea, a Russian scarf, pure linen napkins, embroidered
with my initial, a box of candy for Christmas that has a Russian Santa
Claus on it.</p>

<p>I said to Lee. "Lee, I want to know one thing. Why is it you decided to return
back to the United States when you had a job in Russia, and as far as
I know you seemed to be pretty well off, because of the gifts that you have sent
me. And you are married to a Russian girl, and she would be better off in her
homeland than here. I want to know."</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, not even Marina knows why I have returned to the United
States."</p>

<p>And that is all the information I ever got out of my son.</p>

<p>"Not even Marina knows why I have returned to the United States."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you get along when you were there together with
Marina and your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, that was a very happy month, Mr. Rankin. Marina was
very happy. She had the best home, I believe, that she had ever had. And
Lee&mdash;I was taking Lee out to work every morning, looking for work, through
the unemployment commission, and ads in the paper. And I was taking
care of the baby and doing the cooking, and Marina was helping clean up.
And she would wash the dishes. And Lee and Marina would go for long
walks every afternoon, and I would take care of the baby. Marina would
sing around the house, and watch the television and comment on different
programs, programs that she had seen in Russia.</p>

<p>She knew&mdash;there was a picture with Gregory Peck, and she said, "Mama,
I know Gregory Peck."</p>

<p>And she was singing Santa Lucia.</p>

<p>And here again in my stupidity, I said to Lee, "Lee, she knows English, she
is singing Santa Lucia."</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, that is an international song."</p>

<p>Marina was very happy, and I was very happy to have the children.</p>

<p>And Lee desperately looked for work.</p>

<p>He was offered several good jobs from the State Employment Office of
Texas. One in particular, I remember he said that he regretted not getting
the job, but they told him because his wife was not an American citizen, that
they would not be able to hire him.</p>

<p>He met obstacles all the way.</p>

<p>This one particular woman at the Texas employment agency took an interest
in Lee and went out all the way to give Lee clues for jobs. And I, myself,
took Lee job-hunting every day.</p>

<p>And it is through the employment office that he became employed 3 weeks
later, after he was in my home, by the Leslie Manufacturing Co. in Fort
Worth, which is a sheetmetal place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, while Marina was living with you there, and your son,
and the little <span class="locked">baby&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you talk to Marina, and did she speak English to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, she spoke English, Mr. Rankin. Like she would say&mdash;and
we used the dictionary when she didn't understand.</p>

<p>She would say&mdash;I would say, "Marina, you now nurse your baby."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mama.   The time."</p>

<p>Or "No time."</p>

<p>With motions&mdash;"no time. Mama."</p>

<p>She spoke English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What I would like to find out for the Commission, if we can,
in regard to speaking English, did you think she was able to talk English
fluently, or did you think she was in the process of learning it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She was in the process of learning. But she understood
more than she could talk.</p>

<p>And I have a letter from Lee stating that Marina also speaks and understands
French, that she had learned at grammar school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know French?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So you could not tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I could not tell.</p>

<p>And I didn't think a thing of it.</p>

<p>And, of course. Marina and Lee spoke Russian all the time, even in front
of me.</p>

<p>And you asked about this time&mdash;it was a very happy time. They would
sit at the table. They were playing a game, and I said to Lee, "What is it
you are doing?"</p>

<p>Because they were always talking in Russian.</p>

<p>"Mother, we are playing a game which is similar to American tic-tac-toe."</p>

<p>And they also taught each other. They had books. They are both children&mdash;very
intelligent and studious. Lee was teaching Marina English, and
Marina was teaching him some things that he wanted to know about Russia,
in my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you were saying that he got this job at the Leslie Manufacturing
Co.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>And then his first pay&mdash;he kept his first pay. And then the second pay,
he rented the home on Mercedes Street, which is the south side, and approximately
10 blocks from where I lived at the Rotary Apartment, and approximately
10 blocks from where he was to work.</p>

<p>Lee had no car, and Lee walked to and back from work, which helped to
save money.</p>

<p>Now, you must understand that this couple had no money, and had nothing.
I gave them some dishes, and some silverware, and just a few little things
that I could help out with.</p>

<p>But Lee did have the first week's pay.</p>

<p>And then the second week's pay. And he rented this home which was $59.50
a month. It was a nice little one-bedroom furnished duplex, in a nice neighborhood,
convenient to his work.</p>

<p>But then that leaves the boy broke.</p>

<p>I brought food into the house. I never like to talk about the other members
of the family, because to me that is speculation. But I know that Robert
brought food, also, in the house. And they were not in want. Marina nursed
June.</p>

<p>Now, it has been stated in the paper that the Russian friends have gone into
the home and they are talking about this home, and found that they were in
desperate straits, that there was no food in the house, and no milk for the baby.</p>

<p>I say Marina nursed the baby.</p>

<p>They may have walked into this home, where maybe they didn't have at that
particular time any milk in the box. Maybe Lee was going to bring groceries
home. But I know they were not in destitute circumstances in that respect.</p>

<p>They had no money and didn't have anything. I brought groceries, and I
brought a roll of scotch toweling. I had bought two packs and I gave them one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
And the next day when I went by, the scotch toweling was in the kitchen, on
a coat hanger, with a nail.</p>

<p>And I think that is real nice, a young couple that doesn't have any money,
that they can use their imagination, and put up the scotch toweling to use on a
coat hanger. They are just starting married life in a new country. And they
have no money. But here is the point. The Russian friends, who were established,
and had cars and fine homes, could not see this Russian girl doing without.
They are the ones that interfered. They are the ones that interfered, and
were not happy the way this Russian girl&mdash;and within a short time, then, this
Russian girl had a playpen, had a sewing machine, had a baby bed, and a Taylor
Tot. And this all came out in the paper&mdash;that they supplied this to the girl,
because she was in need of these things.</p>

<p>I say it is not necessary for a young couple to have a playpen for a baby. We
have millions and millions of American couples in the United States that cannot
afford playpens for the children. I, myself, have been in that position.</p>

<p>So I think those things were immaterial.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to bring out is that these Russian friends have interfered
in their lives, and thought that the Russian girl should have more than
necessary.</p>

<p>And my son could not supply these things at that particular time. He was just
starting to work.</p>

<p>This, to me, is very strong in my mind, that there are a lot of Russian friends
that were made immediately, that have interfered and have publicly stated&mdash;a
circle of friends, approximately eight or nine, that would not give their names
in the paper, they were interviewed by Mr. Tinsley of the Star Telegram&mdash;that
has downed Lee for every way possible.</p>

<p>So these are the Russian friends who are established with cars, and didn't
think that the Russian girl was getting a good break in America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were there any differences between you and Lee Oswald or
Marina while they were in your home? Did you have any quarrels?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, no, sir, none at all.</p>

<p>Now, there was one thing. And I will point out the character of my son, and
what I am saying about the playpen and so on.</p>

<p>Now, this was all done within a few weeks time. They moved there&mdash;they
left my home in July, and they moved there in August, and then they moved to
Dallas in October. So it was in this period of time that all these things were
accumulated from Russian friends.</p>

<p>And no man likes other people giving&mdash;interfering in his way of living, and
giving all these things to his wife that he himself cannot supply. This is a
human trait, I would say.</p>

<p>Now, I want to bring this story up.</p>

<p>I could not afford to buy a bed for my grandchild, because I have worked prior
to this for nothing. The job that I had quit I was making $25 a week, gentlemen&mdash;a
24-hour live-in job. The jobs prior to this I worked for $10 a week, 7
days a week, a live-in job.</p>

<p>Because of Lee's so-called defection, and my accident, the way I was treated,
left destitute, without any medical or compensation, I decided to devote my life
to humanity, and I became a practical nurse. And I have worked for $5 a week,
living in the place.</p>

<p>So I had no money, I had $200 saved, when I came to Fort Worth, and that is
what I rented the house with, and brought the food with.</p>

<p>So then that leaves me broke.</p>

<p>So I gave up a job in order to help this girl.</p>

<p>So to get back now to the home, Mr. Rankin&mdash;we had no quarrels. This
month was beautiful. Marina was very happy.</p>

<p>I had the car and the television, and we went around.</p>

<p>As I say, they were free to go and come like they want. They would take
long walks.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Fort Worth, Tex., from the Rotary Apartment
to Leonard Brothers is approximately 3 miles, and they used to walk there,
and they came home&mdash;Marina came home with a Cancan petticoat and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
hose that Lee bought here with a few dollars that Robert and I had given him&mdash;he
spent on his wife.</p>

<p>So that was a very happy time.</p>

<p>Now, when they lived in the home on Mercedes Street that he rented, I was
employed as an OB, a nurse, in Fort Worth, Tex., at an OB's salary. And that
salary, gentlemen, will astonish you. I worked, lived in, for $9 a day, 24 hours
duty.</p>

<p>On an OB case&mdash;I am very busy with the baby all day long because people
are coming in and out, giving presents and so on. I have a 10 o'clock feeding
for the baby. And it is approximately 11 o'clock before I am through and in
bed. The baby is up again at 2 o'clock. It is approximately 3:30 before I
am through again with the baby. The baby is up again at 5:30. And it
is approximately&mdash;then my day starts. I am stressing the point that I
worked for $9 a day during all that, a $9 a day job. So that is 7 days a
week, $63.</p>

<p>Now, this is the first time I have had a nurse's salary, I want you to
understand.</p>

<p>So with my first pay, I bought Marina clothes, I bought the baby clothes, and
I brought food into this home. I went all out for Marina. I just love her,
and was just thrilled to death with her. And I bought a highchair. I
could not afford a bed, because I didn't have enough money to buy the
bed. So that is why I bought the clothes and things of that sort. But I
bought the baby a highchair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did Marina treat you then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fine. But then Marina was not satisfied with the things that I
bought her.</p>

<p>As you see, the way I am properly dressed&mdash;I don't say I mean to be the
height of fashion, but I have&mdash;before becoming a nurse I was in the business
world, and I have been a manager in the merchandise field. So I do know
clothes.</p>

<p>And I bought her some shorts. And she wanted short shorts, like the Americans.
She pictured America in her mind evidently.</p>

<p>And I bought her a little longer shorts.</p>

<p>And "I no like, Mama."</p>

<p>I said, "Marina, you are a married woman and it is proper for you to have
a little longer shorts than the younger girls."</p>

<p>"No, Mama."</p>

<p>And I will stress this&mdash;that Marina was never too happy&mdash;"No, Mama, no
nice, no, Mama, no this."</p>

<p>That was perfectly all right. I thought she didn't understand our ways. I
didn't feel badly about it.</p>

<p>I am going to get back to the highchair, to give you a picture of my son.</p>

<p>I bought the highchair and brought it over there, and Lee was not at
home. And Marina didn't know what a highchair was. And she told me in
Russian. I said, "How do they feed babies in Russia?" By this time, June
was 4 or 5 months old, just getting ready to sit up.</p>

<p>"We put baby on lap, Mama, and baby eat on lap."</p>

<p>And so a highchair to me, I think, was new to Marina.</p>

<p>So approximately 2 or 3 days later I go over there and Lee says to me,
"Now, Mother, I want you to understand right here and now&mdash;I want you
to stop giving all these gifts to me and my wife. I want to give Marina
whatever is necessary, the best I can do. I want you to keep your money
and take care of yourself, because today or tomorrow you take sick, and you
spend all your money on us, I will have to take care of you." Which makes
very good sense.</p>

<p>But he strongly put me in my place about buying things for his wife that
he himself could not buy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I agreed with him. And I said&mdash;the shock of it&mdash;I realize
what a mother-in-law I was in interfering. And, of course, that is part that
we mothers-in-law do unconsciously. We try to help out our children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
in a way we are interfering in their life. They would rather have their own
way of doing things.</p>

<p>And I realize that I had interfered, and the boy wanted to take care of
his wife. So no more was said about it.</p>

<p>I go into many homes, being a nurse, and I see this problem also, where
the mothers and mothers-in-law bring things, and the men strongly object to
it&mdash;they would rather do without, and have their wife do without, and they
themselves be the master of the home.</p>

<p>So then I realized I was being a foolish mother-in-law, and that he was
perfectly right.</p>

<p>I should save my money and take care of myself. He had a wife and
baby to take care of. If I didn't have any money, he might have to take
care of me. So I agreed with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Marina say anything about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, no, Marina didn't know&mdash;unless she understood the
English part. I have no way of knowing, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right. Tell us what happened after that, then.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, let me think just a minute.</p>

<p>This, gentlemen, is very emotional to me, because it is a humanitarian side
that I am trying to bring out. Material things are involved to me that
are of no consequence. And I am trying to point out the fact that these Russian
people seemed to think that the Russian girl should have material things.</p>

<p>And all through my story, I can prove things that have happened of this
nature.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;I will continue.</p>

<p>I was on the OB case for very wealthy people. I then became a nurse
and by word of mouth I had worked in the finest homes in Fort Worth at
this salary. I have worked for Ammon Carter, Jr., who is the owner of
the Star Telegram. I have worked in his home. I have worked for Dr.
Ross seven weeks in his home. I have worked for Mayor Vandergriff.
I took care of his last baby in his home. And I can go on and on.</p>

<p>So I have been employed in over 200 homes at this salary. So I know the
difference of working in very poor homes, people on welfare, that I worked
in, and then working in the rich homes. So I have experience, gentlemen,
is what I am trying to say.</p>

<p>So I mentioned to Mrs. Rosenthal that Lee and Marina didn't have a baby
bed, and Lee didn't have work clothes. He had had his suits from the United
States yet with him when he went to Russia. But he needed work clothes
since he got this job.</p>

<p>She said, "Mrs. Oswald, what build is he?"</p>

<p>And I told her. And he was about the same build as her husband.</p>

<p>So she got out a lot of work clothes that her husband didn't want. However,
she asked me $10 for 12 pairs of used pants. And I would not buy&mdash;give her $12.
Here is a very wealthy woman, and she knows the story. And she knows that
I have no money. And yet she expects me to pay for his used clothing. And
so I have this principle about me. And I did not buy the used clothing, the
clothing for Lee.</p>

<p>Now, Lee is having a birthday, which is October 18th. And this is approximately
the 6th or 7th of October.</p>

<p>Now, this Sunday, October 12th, I went&mdash;this is very important, gentleman&mdash;I
went to this home and I was there&mdash;I asked to get off an hour or two to see
the children, from this OB case at the Rosenthals. I went to see my son and
daughter-in-law, and they were nicely dressed. And while there, about 10
minutes, a young couple came into the home, approximately the same age as
Marina and Lee, and they had a little boy who I would say was about 6 or 8
months older than June. The woman put the little boy in the playpen with
June, and June went to touch him, and Marina got up and said, "Oh, no, hurt
baby." She spoke in English. So I said, "Do you speak Russian?" to this
couple. And they said, "No, we don't. We are Americans. But my father"&mdash;and
I will have to say this&mdash;"or grandfather"&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;"is a
Russian, from Siberia, and that is how we know Marina and Lee."</p>

<p>So the conversation was general. And in the general conversation&mdash;now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
this couple was from Dallas, visiting my family in Fort Worth. The conversation
was general.</p>

<p>And she said, "Lee, my father has this place of business in Dallas, and will
offer you a job in Dallas."</p>

<p>I said, "Lee, I didn't know that you wanted to give up your job and
work in Dallas, because the Rosenthals that I am working for, her father owns
the meatpacking house in Dallas, and she has told me that he employs hundreds
of people, and if ever any time that you are in need, to go see her father, that
she would be sure that he would give you a job."</p>

<p>So, gentlemen, this was on a Sunday.</p>

<p>I made coffee, and the house was in order. There was nothing packed.</p>

<p>Lee got paid on a Friday, from the Leslie Sheetmetal Works.</p>

<p>Monday Lee and Marina packed their belongings and went to Dallas.</p>

<p>The point I am bringing, is that Lee had no idea of quitting his job in Fort
Worth, because he was not packed. This was on a Sunday. And this couple
offered a job in Dallas. And their father, her grandfather, was a Russian, and
Lee went to Dallas on a Monday, and worked for the Arts Graphic. I do not
know&mdash;but you probably have that information. His very first job there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he was discharged by the Leslie people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he was not discharged by the Leslie people. He just
didn't show up. He was paid on a Friday, and that Monday he did not show up
for work, because he came to Dallas.</p>

<p>The point I am bringing out is this job was also offered to Lee from a Russian
father. He had no idea of moving. There was nothing packed.</p>

<p>Now, I understand that my son Robert helped him to move. And the way
I know this&mdash;I went there on a Tuesday, and the children had gone, because
they had left on a Monday. So then I went to Robert's home, and Robert was
at work. So I was all upset. They didn't tell me they were leaving.</p>

<p>I said to Veda. "Marina and Lee are no longer there, the house is vacant."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You spoke someone's name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Veda, V-e-d-a. Robert's wife is Veda. I said they had to
move yesterday.</p>

<p>She said "Robert helped them to move, and they gave us the food in the
refrigerator."</p>

<p>I said it came up all of a sudden, and I told the story about the couple being
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the name of that couple?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. And I have not been able to find out.</p>

<p>I have asked Mrs. Paine recently, and she said she does not remember. And
the night I was in Mrs. Paine's home, I asked Marina and Mrs. Paine, and they
did say a name. Marina would know the name of the couple. But I do not
have that information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And was he the owner of this business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The father was the owner of the business. And this was an
American couple. And they did not speak Russian, either one. The father was
a Russian, or the grandfather&mdash;that owned this place of business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I think you said the grandfather before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said either the father or the grandfather. I cannot be sure.</p>

<p>It was the girl's father or grandfather, and not the boy.</p>

<p>So I told my daughter-in-law about this, and she knew about it.</p>

<p>So now here is something that I would like to have my daughter-in-law as a
witness.</p>

<p>It has been stated in the paper that my son was giving Marina black eyes and
possibly had beat her. And this is by the Russian people.</p>

<p>Now, living in this home in Fort Worth, I had gone by several times I had a
day off, and Marina was not at home.</p>

<p>I said to her, "Marina, Mama come to see you yesterday. You no home."
She didn't answer.</p>

<p>I said, "Marina, Mama come see you. You no home, Marina."</p>

<p>"No. I go to lady's house to take English lessons."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know who she was speaking of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know for a fact. But my son Robert will know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
And that is why it is important to call him. That is what I am trying to say,
Chief Justice Warren. These others will know this part of my story, give you
the facts.</p>

<p>I am assuming it is Mr. Peter Gregory's wife that started these lessons.
But Marina was taking English lessons.</p>

<p>Now, they lived at a corner house, and there is Carol Street, and opposite Carol
Street is a parking lot for Montgomery Ward. They live approximately two
blocks from Montgomery Ward. So I had gone by, as I am stating, several
times. You have to understand&mdash;this is just 6 or 7 weeks that they are in this
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You say "they." I am sorry to interrupt.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina and Lee, in this home.</p>

<p>Then Marina was not home. I could not understand where so fast that
they could have so many friends, that this Russian girl didn't speak English
and know her way about, could be gone all day long. That worried me.</p>

<p>So I sat in the car on Montgomery Ward's parking lot, where I could see the
house, because I wanted to see who Marina was going to come home with.</p>

<p>The door was open. I went in the house and no one was there.</p>

<p>By this time, I was wondering how she could be gone all the time, being a
stranger in town.</p>

<p>I sat in the car all day long. She didn't show up.</p>

<p>Finally, I went home, had my supper, left my apartment, and on the way
going back to the house Lee was leaving Montgomery Ward.</p>

<p>Now, they did not have a phone. I am just assuming&mdash;this is not a fact&mdash;that
Lee went to a telephone trying to locate his wife, because I was coming
from Montgomery Ward. He got in the car with me, and we had about a block
to go. I entered the home with Lee, and I said, "Lee where is Marina?" Of
course, I knew that she wasn't home, because I had stayed in the car all day.</p>

<p>He said, "Oh, I guess she is out with some friends."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to fix your supper?"</p>

<p>"No, she will probably be home in time to fix my supper?"</p>

<p>So I left. I am not going to interfere in their married life. But I did offer
to fix him supper. And I went back to make sure Marina still wasn't home.</p>

<p>I walked in the home with my son.</p>

<p>So approximately 2 days later&mdash;not approximately, but 2 days later I went to
the home and my son was reading, he read continuously&mdash;in the living room,
and Marina was in the bedroom, I could not see Marina. And I said to Lee,
"Tell Marina, I am here."</p>

<p>Marina made no appearance.</p>

<p>So I went into the bedroom, and she was nursing June with her head down.
And I started to talk. And she still had her head down. And I came around
to the front and I saw Marina with a black eye.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I don't think any man should hit his wife, as is stated in
the paper, or beat his wife. But I will say this. There may be times that a
woman needs to have a black eye. I am not condoning the act. But I strongly
am saying that this girl was not home. And this man was working. And I
saw, myself, that this man came home and didn't have any food. This couple
doesn't have a maid or anyone to give this working man food. And I think it
was her duty to be home and have his supper ready.</p>

<p>That is a little thing, maybe. But to me it shows the character of what I am
trying to bring out.</p>

<p>And so there may have been reasons that the children fought. And I also
know that many, many couples fight, of our finest people, because I made it
clear before that I have worked in these very fine homes, and have seen very
fine people fight. I have seen a gentleman strike his wife in front of me. We
know this happens. It is not a nice thing to do. But it happens in our finest
homes. I am not condoning the act. But I am telling you that there probably
was reasons, we will say. The woman has a black eye, and he is a louse&mdash;he
gave her a black eye, but we must consider why did he give her a black eye.
We always must consider the second aspect of the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she take the baby with her when you <span class="locked">looked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she took&mdash;always the baby was with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask Marina how she got the black eye or anything
about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, in the bedroom. I was shocked.</p>

<p>"Mama&mdash;Lee." Just like that.</p>

<p>So I went in the living room and I said, "Lee, what do you mean by striking
Marina?"</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, that is our affair."</p>

<p>And so that ended. I wasn't going to interfere any further.</p>

<p>Now, this has been publicly stated by the Russian friends, that he beat his
wife. I don't know if he did beat his wife. I happened to see the black eye.
I know that he hit her and gave her a black eye. Marina said so, and my son
has said so. But how many times does this happen, I don't know.</p>

<p>But I am trying to point out that I don't approve of it. But I am trying to
point out that everything is not according to Hoyle, as we say in our American
way of life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there any other time that you recall that you saw that she
had bruises or a black eye?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that is the only time.</p>

<p>And then the children moved to Dallas.</p>

<p>Now, this will end that part of the story.</p>

<p>I have accepted and I have the public papers, in 1959, when Lee went to
Russia&mdash;I made a statement that as an individual I thought he had a right
to make up his own mind in the decision to do what he wanted. I am of that
nature, because, gentlemen, today or tomorrow I may decide to go to Russia,
I will go. We are taught that in America, that we have the right to do what
we want as an individual. So I publicly stated in 1959 that Lee had a right,
if he wanted to live in that country. And I think it was courage that he did
so, instead of staying in America and talking about America, and living here
and downing his country. It took courage to go and live where he wanted to live.</p>

<p>I was criticized highly for making that statement. And it is published in
1959&mdash;as far back as that.</p>

<p>So I will get back now to when the children left.</p>

<p>They did not tell me they had left.</p>

<p>So I accepted the fact that my son Lee did not want me to know that he was
in Dallas.</p>

<p>Why I accepted the fact is because of Lee's so-called defection.</p>

<p>I have had it very hard, Mr. Rankin, and gentlemen&mdash;I have lost jobs, I was
in a position, if I was in a home and television was on, and something political
was on television, and the people commented, I felt it was necessary to keep
quiet, because of it. Because of the defection I thought if I would express my
views they might think I was a Communist like my son was supposed to be.
And in many a home I have been in&mdash;after three or four days they would tell
me my services were not needed.</p>

<p>I cannot say, sure it was because of Lee's defection. However, I feel sure
that it is, because I am a respected person, and a very good nurse, as has been
stated in the paper. And my jobs were gotten from word of mouth.</p>

<p>But you must understand that I deal with a lot of people. So naturally
it is natural that some of them would feel resentful against me because of my
son defecting to Russia and presumably being a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever find out where Marina was that day that you
tried to locate her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, no sir, that ended that.</p>

<p>So I respected my son's wish, since he didn't want to tell me where he was
in Dallas, that I would accept that fact.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, this may seem hard that I accept these things. But it is not.
I am self-supporting. I have a life of my own. And if Lee decides that that
is the way he wants it, I am not going to grieve and worry about it. I have
to get my sleep in order to work. I have the ability of accepting things, the
ability granted me by the grace of God, because of my difficulty in life. I have
been a widow. I have had many, many obstacles, and I have had to face them.
And my faith gets stronger. I do accept things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
As now, I accept the death of my son. I don't brood over that. I have that
ability of doing that.</p>

<p>So I just accepted the fact&mdash;when Lee gets ready to let me know where he is,
fine&mdash;up until that time, it is his privilege to do what he wants.</p>

<p>Now, that is the last contact I have had with Marina and Lee until the news
broke in Dallas that Lee was picked up because of the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Tell us about this period you were talking about, when he went
to Dallas. Was that before or after the time he went to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was before the time, sir&mdash;he lived&mdash;from my apartment,
the Rotary Apartments, when Lee got the job he lived on Mercedes Street from
the end of July, I would say, or the beginning of September, until October, when
he left to go to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What year was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was in 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean '62?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry&mdash;1962. And that was the last I had seen of Marina
and Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever find where they were in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I explained before that I made no attempt. I thought
when they get ready to let me know, that is fine.   Up until then, I had to do
my own work and take care of myself. And I do respect other people's privileges.
If that is the way they want it, fine.</p>

<p>When they get ready to let me know, I will welcome them. If not, I will
go about my own business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you learned they had gone to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had not learned of that until after the assassination.   I knew
nothing, I had no contact with them.</p>

<p>So, then, the next thing we should start then would be the Dallas&mdash;the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Whatever you know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I was on a case in a rest home, and I had a 3 to 11 shift.
I was dressed, ready to go to work. I was watching&mdash;I am a little ahead of
my story.</p>

<p>I watched the television in the morning before I was dressed. And Richard
Nixon was in Dallas, and he made a television appearance approximately 2
hours before President Kennedy was to arrive in Dallas. And, as a layman,
I remember saying, "Well, the audacity of him, to make this statement against
President Kennedy just an hour or two before his arrival in Dallas."</p>

<p>And then I had my lunch, and I dressed, with my nurse's uniform on, to go
to work, for the 3 to 11 shift. And I have to leave home at 2:30. So I had
a little time to watch the Presidential procession.</p>

<p>And while sitting on the sofa, the news came that the President was shot.
And there was a witness on television, a man and a little girl on television.
However, I could not continue to watch it. I had to report to work.</p>

<p>So I went in the car, and approximately seven blocks away I turned the radio
on in the car. I heard that Lee Harvey Oswald was picked up as a suspect.</p>

<p>I immediately turned the car around and came back home, got on the telephone,
called Acme Brick in Fort Worth, and asked where Robert was, because
he had been traveling, and I must get in touch with Robert immediately, because
his brother was picked up as a suspect in the assassination. So they had Robert
call me.</p>

<p>Robert didn't know that Lee was picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was this the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, the day of the assassination, they picked Lee up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And 3 to 11&mdash;that is in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was 2:30, because I was on my way to work, and I had
to be at work at 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Three in the afternoon is when you had to be at work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, and it was 2:30 I heard the news and went back
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
I had Acme Brick call Robert to give him the news, and Robert called me, and
he had not heard his brother was picked up.</p>

<p>Now, Robert is in Denton. So I called the Star Telegram, and asked that&mdash;if
they could possibly have someone escort me to Dallas, because I realized
I could not drive to Dallas. And they did. They sent two men to escort me
to Dallas.</p>

<p>The name of one is Bob Shieffer, the other name I will have for you gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who are those? Are those reporters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Star Telegram reporters, sent by the Star Telegram editor to
escort me to Dallas.</p>

<p>Now, upon arriving in Dallas, I did not ask&mdash;I did not want to talk to the
police. I asked specifically to talk to FBI agents. My wish was granted, I was
sent into a room. I have to backtrack my story.</p>

<p>The policemen do not know I am here&mdash;"I want to talk to FBI agents."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What time of the day is this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is approximately 3:30. So I am escorted into an office,
and two Brown FBI agents, they are brothers, I understand, and there was
another man that I do not know the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By that you mean their names were Brown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Their names were Brown. And I have the correct names, also.
But we were in this room, and I told them who I was. And I said, "I want to
talk with you gentlemen because I feel like my son is an agent of the government,
and for the security of my country, I don't want this to get out."</p>

<p>But, first, I said to them, "I want to talk to FBI agents from Washington."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Oswald, we are from Washington, we work with Washington."</p>

<p>I said, "I understand you work with Washington. But I want officials from
Washington," and I believed they would be in town because of protecting the
President.</p>

<p>I said, "I do not want local FBI men. What I have to say I want to say to
Washington men."</p>

<p>Of course they wanted the news. They said, "Well, we work through Washington."</p>

<p>I said, "I know you do. But I would like Washington men."</p>

<p>So I had no choice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell them why you thought he was an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I am coming to this.</p>

<p>So I said, "I have information that"&mdash;I told him who I was.</p>

<p>I said, "For the security of my country, I want this kept perfectly quiet until
you investigate. I happen to know that the State Department furnished the
money for my son to return back to the United States, and I don't know if that
would be made public what that would involve, and so please will you investigate
this and keep this quiet."</p>

<p>Of course that was news to them.</p>

<p>They left me sitting in the office.</p>

<p>And I also told them that Congressman Jim Wright knew about this.</p>

<p>"You can be sure we will question Jim Wright."</p>

<p>And I gave them the names of the four men I had talked with while in
Washington.</p>

<p>Would you like those four names now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One is Mr. Boster, who was special counsel in charge of Soviet
affairs.</p>

<p>One was Mr. Stanfield. I should know the names.</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, Mr. Doyle will see that I give you the names of these men.
I had it in a little card and carried it all these years from my Washington trip
and gave it to the FBI men to investigate.</p>

<p>So they left me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you say you understand that the State Department paid
your son's way back from the Soviet <span class="locked">Union&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever learn that that was a loan?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> I have the document to state that they loaned Lee the money
to come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you didn't know that at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. But I stated&mdash;you see, I was worried about the
security of my country. I didn't know if the public would find out&mdash;how they
would take the news that the State Department loaned him the money, since
now he is a Marxist and an accused assassin.</p>

<p>I was worried about my country. And I didn't want the public to know.
I wanted the FBI, not the police, to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know anything else that you told them about why you
thought he was an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I didn't tell them anything. But they questioned me,
started to question me.</p>

<p>One of them said, "You know a lot about your son. When was the last time
you were in touch with him?"</p>

<p>That wasn't the Browns. That was the other man.</p>

<p>I said, "I have not seen my son in a year."</p>

<p>He said sarcastically, "Now, Mrs. Oswald, are we to believe you have not been
in touch with your son in a year? You are a mother."</p>

<p>I said, "Believe what you want. But I have not been in touch with my son
in a year. My son did not want me involved. He has kept me out of his
activities. That is the truth, God's truth, that I have not seen my son in a year."</p>

<p>And the gentleman left, and I did not see them after that.</p>

<p>They sent the stenographer that was in the outer office to sit with me, and she
started to question me.</p>

<p>I said, "Young lady, I am not going to be questioned. You may just as well
make up your mind that I am just going to sit here. What I want, if you will
relay&mdash;have these two Star Telegram men come in here, please. I would like
to ask them something."</p>

<p>So they came in. And I said, "Bob, I have rights and I want to see Lee."</p>

<p>Of course the men didn't answer.</p>

<p>But I sat in the office approximately 2 or 3 hours alone, gentlemen, with this
woman who came in and out.</p>

<p>I said, "If you think you are going to question me or get information from me,
you are not."</p>

<p>And I sat in the office 2 or 3 hours.</p>

<p>Every now and then I would walk up to the outer corridor and say to whoever
was there, "Now, listen, I am getting tired of this. I want to see Lee."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What office was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The courthouse in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Whose office was it in? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't know. It was a private office that lead&mdash;for
instance, it would be like in the corner, a glass-enclosed office. And then you
could see the outer corridor where the stenographers and the police and everybody
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know whose office it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not. So I sat there approximately 3 hours. And
I never did get to see Lee.</p>

<p>So at 5:30&mdash;then Robert came in. And he was questioned by the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you there when he was questioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>And I will state now emphatically that I have never been questioned by the
FBI or the Secret Service&mdash;never, gentlemen. If they can produce my voice or
anything, they can produce it.</p>

<p>So then I was escorted into the office where Marina and Mrs. Paine was. And,
of course, I started crying right away, and hugged Marina. And Marina gave
me Rachel, whom I had never seen. I did not know I had a second grandchild,
until this very moment. So I started to cry. Marina started to cry. And
Mrs. Paine said, "Oh, Mrs. Oswald, I am so glad to meet you. Marina has often
expressed the desire to contact you, especially when the baby was being born.
But Lee didn't want her to."</p>

<p>And I said, "Mrs. Paine, you spoke English. Why didn't you contact me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
She said Marina didn't know how to get in touch with me.</p>

<p>She said, "Well, because of the way they lived, he lived in Dallas, and came
home to my home on weekends. I didn't feel like I wanted to interfere."</p>

<p>And she acted as&mdash;excuse me, gentlemen, but this is very, very emotional.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> That is all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She acted as interpreter for Marina. We are in the courthouse
now, in the jailhouse.</p>

<p>So her testimony, gentlemen, the testimony that the Dallas police have, is
the testimony of Mrs. Paine, that Marina assumed Lee had given her.</p>

<p>Could we state now maybe it is not the correct testimony that Marina gave&mdash;just
one interpreter, and Marina's friend, is the testimony that the Dallas police
has.</p>

<p>I have no way of knowing, and you have no way of knowing, gentlemen,
whether it is the correct testimony.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Paine told me that she acted as interpreter.</p>

<p>And I said, "I don't know what I am going to do. I want to stay in Dallas
and be near Lee, so that I can help with this situation as much as possible."</p>

<p>She said, "Mrs. Oswald, you are welcome in my home&mdash;if you care to sleep on
the sofa."</p>

<p>I said, "Thank you very much, Mrs. Paine, I will accept your offer. I will
sleep on the floor in order to be near Dallas."</p>

<p>So we left.    We went to Mrs. Paine's home.</p>

<p>I am going to say again I did not see my son.</p>

<p>So&mdash;I had my nurse's uniform on for 3 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What day was this at Mrs. Paine's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was the night of Friday, November 22d. We arrived
there approximately 6 o'clock. Upon entering the home, about 5 minutes after
I was in the home, there was a knock on the door.</p>

<p>Now, this is a little vague. On the way leaving the courthouse we may have
been in the company of the two Life representatives. They may have taken
us to Mrs. Paine's home. I did not ask who was taking us to Mrs. Paine's home,
because I was holding my grandbaby and talking to Marina, and sitting in the
back of the car. And it didn't interest me at the time how I was getting to Mrs.
Paine's home.</p>

<p>Why I am bringing this up was because after I was in her home, about 5
minutes, there was a knock on the door, and these two Life representatives
entered the home.</p>

<p>The name of the men, one is Allan Grant, and the other is Tommy Thompson.</p>

<p>And I was not introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you ever seen them before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I had never seen them before. As I say, they could have been
the men driving the car. But I want you to understand at the time I didn't
notice that, because I was holding my new grandbaby, and comforting my
daughter-in-law, and talking to Mrs. Paine in the back seat of the car.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Paine sat on the floor. And she said to the photographer&mdash;he had a
camera in front of him&mdash;"Now, I hope you have good color film, because I want
good pictures."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What time of the day was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was approximately 6:30. We had just arrived in Mrs.
Paine's home&mdash;I would say 6 and 7 o'clock, approximately, between that time.
We are home 5 minutes when they knocked on the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine immediately says, "Gentlemen, I hope you have colored film so
we will have some good pictures."</p>

<p>I didn't know who they were.</p>

<p>But then I knew they were newsmen, because of her statement and the
camera.</p>

<p>So Tommy Thompson started to interview Mrs. Paine. He said, "Mrs. Paine,
tell me, are Marina and Lee separated, since Lee lives in Dallas?"</p>

<p>She said, "No, they are a happy family. Lee lives in Dallas because of necessity.
He works in Dallas, and this is Irving, and he has no transportation,
and he comes every weekend to see his family."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "What type family man is he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
She said, "A normal family man. He plays with his children. Last night
he fed June. He watches television and just normal things."</p>

<p>She went on.</p>

<p>So he said, "Mrs. Paine, can you tell me how Lee got, the money to"&mdash;I am
sorry&mdash;"can you tell me how Lee was able to return back to the United States
financially?"</p>

<p>She said, "Oh, yes, he saved the money to come back to the United States."</p>

<p>Now, while this little episode went on, I was fuming, gentlemen, because I
didn't want this type of publicity. I thought it was uncalled for, immediately
after the assassination, and the consequent arrest of my son.</p>

<p>But I was in Mrs. Paine's home.</p>

<p>Now I had an opportunity to be gracious. I spoke up and I said&mdash;I am ahead
of myself.</p>

<p>She answered that he saved the money.</p>

<p>I spoke up and I said, "Now, Mrs. Paine, I am sorry. I am in your home.
And I appreciate the fact that I am a guest in your home. But I will not have
you making statements that are incorrect. Because I happen to know you have
made an incorrect statement. To begin with, I do not approve of this publicity.
And if we are going to have the life story with Life magazine"&mdash;by that time
I knew what it was&mdash;"I would like to get paid. Here is my daughter-in-law with
two small children, and I, myself, am penniless, and if we are going to give
this information, I believe we should get paid for it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think Mrs. Paine was trying to get paid for it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Possibly. But I do know this. It was prearranged. That is
the point that is important. That after a few hours time, the Life representatives
were invited to her home, into her home, because she expected them, you
see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think she arranged it, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, possibly with Marina's help.</p>

<p>I do not know. It was arranged&mdash;I am positive&mdash;the way they entered the
home. She invited them in, without even introducing me. And immediately
said she hoped they had color film.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were they talking to each other, Marina, and Mrs. Paine, while
you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they talked in Russian. And that is a difficult part. I
didn't know Russian.</p>

<p>Then, with that, the Life representative got up and said, "Mrs. Oswald, I will
call my office and see what they think about an arrangement of your life
story."</p>

<p>So he did call the office. He closed the door and called in private. And
nothing was said&mdash;in the living room.</p>

<p>When I say nothing was said, it was between myself and the other representative.
Mrs. Paine was talking to my daughter-in-law in Russian. I was
talking to my daughter-in-law in English. It was a regular general conversation,
as far as I knew.</p>

<p>He came out from the telephone conversation and said, no, that the company
would not allow him to pay for the story. What they would do&mdash;they would
pay our expenses while in Dallas, and our food and expenses, hotel accommodation.</p>

<p>So I told him that I would think about it.</p>

<p>Now, they continued to hang around. And they were taking pictures continuously,
all the while this was going on&mdash;the photographer, Mr. Allen was
continuously taking pictures. I was awfully tired and upset. I rolled my
stockings down, and the picture is in Life Magazine. And he stopped that.
So I got up and said, "I am not having this invasion of privacy. I realize
that I am in Mrs. Paine's home. But you are taking my picture without my
consent, and a picture that I certainly don't want made public." It is the
worst&mdash;with me rolling my hose. I wanted to get comfortable.</p>

<p>He followed Marina around in the bedroom. She was undressing June.
He took pictures of everything. And Mrs. Paine was in her glory&mdash;I will say
this. Mrs. Paine was very happy all these pictures were taken. And I had to
go behind Marina to see that the photographers were not taking her, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
were taking me. And it was just a regular&mdash;the home was a living room and
a hall and a bedroom and kitchen, and we were all going around in circles.</p>

<p>And the photographer was taking pictures, until finally I became indignant,
and said, "I have had it. Now, find out what accommodations you can make
for us, for my daughter-in-law and I so that we can be in Dallas to help Lee, and
let me know in the morning."</p>

<p>So they left.</p>

<p>However, about an hour later there was a telephone call to Mrs. Paine from
a Life representative. I know by her conversation who she was talking to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One of the men&mdash;either Allen Grant or Tommy Thompson.</p>

<p>And after the conversation, I said to her, "Was that one of the Life representatives?"</p>

<p>And she said, "Oh, yes, he just was a little upset about what happened."</p>

<p>So I got no information there.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Would you like to take a short recess, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I am getting thirsty.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Suppose we do. We will take one for about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. Mrs. Oswald, you may
continue with your statement.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Now, we are in Mrs. Paine's home yet.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. This is on the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;the 22d, Friday, the 22d.</p>

<p>I am worried because Lee hasn't had an attorney. And I am talking about
that, and Mrs. Paine said, "Oh, don't worry about that. I am a member of the
Civil Liberties Union, and Lee will have an attorney, I can assure you."</p>

<p>I said to myself but when? Of course, I didn't want to push her, argue with
her. But the point was if she was a member of the Union, why didn't she see
Lee had an attorney then. So I wasn't too happy about that.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, this is some very important facts.</p>

<p>My daughter-in-law spoke to Mrs. Paine in Russian. "Mamma," she says.
So she takes me into the bedroom and closes the door. She said, "Mamma, I
show you." She opened the closet, and in the closet was a lot of books and
papers. And she came out with a picture&mdash;a picture of Lee, with a gun.</p>

<p>It said, "To my daughter June"&mdash;written in English.</p>

<p>I said, "Oh, Marina, police." I didn't think anything of the picture.</p>

<p>Now, you must understand that I don't know what is going on on television&mdash;I
came from the jailhouse and everything, so I don't know all the circumstances,
what evidence they had against my son by this time. I had no way of knowing.
But I say to my daughter, "To my daughter, June," anybody can own a rifle,
to go hunting. You yourself probably have a rifle. So I am not connecting
this with the assassination&mdash;"To my daughter, June." Because I would immediately
say, and I remember&mdash;I think my son is an agent all the time&mdash;no
one is going to be foolish enough if they mean to assassinate the President, or
even murder someone to take a picture of themselves with that rifle, and leave
that there for evidence.</p>

<p>So, I didn't think a thing about it. And it says "To my daughter, June."
I said, "The police," meaning that if the police got that, they would use that
against my son, which would be a natural way to think.</p>

<p>She says, "You take, Mamma."</p>

<p>I said, "No."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma, you take."</p>

<p>I said, "No, Marina. Put back in the book." So she put the picture back in
the book. Which book it was, I do not know.</p>

<p>So the next day, when we are at the courthouse&mdash;this is on Saturday&mdash;she&mdash;we
were sitting down, waiting to see Lee. She puts her shoe down, she says,
"Mamma, picture." She had the picture folded up in her shoe.</p>

<p>Now, I did not see that it was the picture, but I know that it was, because
she told me it was, and I could see it was folded up. It wasn't open for me to
see. I said, "Marina." Just like that. So Robert came along and he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
"Robert" I said, "No, no Marina." I didn't want her to tell Robert about the
picture. Right there, you know. That was about the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever tell her to destroy the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Now, I have to go into this. I want to tell you about
destroying the picture.</p>

<p>Now, that was in Mrs. Paine's home.</p>

<p>I want to start to remember&mdash;because when we leave Mrs. Paine's home, we
go into another phase, where the picture comes in again. So I have to tell the&mdash;unless
you want to ask me specific questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No, you go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Paine, in front of me, gave Marina $10. Now, Mrs.
Paine, when I said, after the representatives left&mdash;I said, "You know, I do want
to get paid for the story, because I am destitute, and here is a girl with&mdash;her
husband is going to be in jail, we will need money for attorneys, with two babies."</p>

<p>She said, "You don't have to worry about Marina. Marina will always have
a home with me, because Marina helps."</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Paine speaks Russian fluently. "She helps me with my Russian
language. She babysits for me and helps me with the housework, and you never
have to worry about Marina. She will always have a home with me."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. and Mrs. Paine are separated. Mr. Paine does not live here. So it
is just the two women.</p>

<p>So, Mrs. Paine didn't graciously do anything for Marina, as the paper stated&mdash;that
Lee never did pay Mrs. Paine for room or board. Mrs. Paine owes them
money. That is almost the kind of work that I do, or the airline stewardesses do,
serve food and everything. Marina was earning her keep, and really should have
had a salary for it&mdash;what I am trying to say, gentlemen, Mrs. Paine had Marina
there to help babysit with the children, with her children&mdash;if she wanted to go
running around and everything.</p>

<p>So actually she wasn't doing my son or Marina the favor that she claims she
was doing.</p>

<p>But the point I am trying to stress is that she did tell me Marina would never
have to worry, because Marina would have a home with her.</p>

<p>At this particular moment, I cannot remember anything of importance in the
house. Otherwise, about the picture I have stated. And Mrs. Paine with the
Life representative, and her saying that Lee would have an attorney, and Mrs.
Paine giving Marina a $10 bill.</p>

<p>Oh, Marina told me, "Mamma, I have this money." It was money in an envelope&mdash;in
the bedroom, when she showed me the picture. I said, "How much
money, Marina."</p>

<p>"About how much?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"About $100 and some."</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Paine has stated to the Life representative that Lee and Marina
were saving his pay in order to have a home for themselves for Christmas time,
because they had never been in a home of their own at Christmas time&mdash;in order
to celebrate Christmas. So, the hundred and some odd dollars isn't a big sum,
considering that Lee paid $8 a week room in Dallas&mdash;and it has been stated by
the landlady that Lee ate lunchmeat or fruit. And Lee was very, very thin
when I saw him. And Lee gave his salary to his wife in order to save to have
this home for Christmas.</p>

<p>So, that is not a lot of money to have in the house&mdash;I would not think so,
because I believe Lee was earning about $50 a week. And let's say he could live
for about $10 or $12. And he gave the rest of the money to his wife.</p>

<p>And so I reported this money to the Secret Service while we were in Six
Flags&mdash;that Marina had the money. I wanted them to know. She showed me
the money.</p>

<p>I cannot think now&mdash;I did think of the money after going back&mdash;but I cannot
think of anything at this particular moment that would be of any benefit that
happened in this house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In regard to the photograph, I will show you some photographs.
Maybe you can tell me whether they are the ones that you are referring to. Here
is Commission's Exhibit 134.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, that is not the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And 133, consists of two different pictures.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>.. No, sir, that is not the picture. He was holding the rifle up,
and it said, "To my daughter, June, with love." He was holding the rifle up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By holding it up, you <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>.. Like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Crosswise, with both hands on the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>.. With both hands on the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Above his head?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever see these pictures, Exhibits 133 and 134?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have never seen those pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you were going to tell us about some further discussion
of the picture you did see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;all right.</p>

<p>Now, so the next morning the two representatives of the Life Magazine,
Mr. Allen Grant and Mr. Tommy Thompson come by at 9 o'clock with a woman,
Russian interpreter, a doctor somebody. I have not been able to find this woman.
I have called the universities, thinking that she was a language teacher, and I&mdash;maybe
you have her name. But she is very, very important to our story.</p>

<p>And I do want to locate her, if possible.</p>

<p>During the night, I had decided I was going to take up their offer, because I
would be besieged by reporters and everything. So why not go with the Life
representatives, and let them pay my room and board and my daughter-in-law's.
They came by at 9 o'clock, without calling, with this Russian interpreter. So
Marina was getting dressed and getting the children dressed. He was taking
pictures all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They came by where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Paine's home. And there was no hurry, though, to leave
the home, because Mrs. Paine was most anxious for the Life representatives to
talk to her and get these pictures and everything&mdash;whether Marina has any part
in this I don't know, because they spoke Russian, and she didn't tell me about
it. But I know Mrs. Paine did.</p>

<p>We left with the two Life representatives. They brought us to the Hotel
Adolphus in Dallas. I immediately upon entering the hotel picked up the phone
and called Captain Will Fritz, to see if Marina and I could see Lee at the
jailhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He is one of the big men in Dallas on this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The Chief of Detectives, or something like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And I called him from the hotel, and the man that
answered the phone said he would relay my message to him, that I wanted to see
if Marina and I could see Lee. I waited on the phone. He came back and said,
"Yes, Mrs. Oswald, Captain Fritz said you may see Lee at 12 o'clock today."</p>

<p>We arrived at the Adolphus Hotel between 9:30 and 10:00.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This was what day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was Saturday, November 23, the morning of Saturday,
November 23.</p>

<p>While we were there, an FBI agent, Mr. Hart Odum entered the room with
another agent, and wanted Marina to accompany him to be questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were these FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; Mr. Hart Odum is an FBI agent. And I said, "No,
we are going to see Lee." We were all eating breakfast when he came in. I
said, "No, we have been promised to see Lee. She is not going with you."</p>

<p>So he said, "Well, will you tell Mrs. Oswald, please"&mdash;to the interpreter, "I
would like to question her and I would like her to come with me to be questioned."</p>

<p>I said, "It is no good. You don't need to tell the interpreter that, because my
daughter-in-law is not going with you. We have been promised to see Lee. And
besides Marina has testified, made her statement at the courthouse yesterday,
and any further statements that Marina will make will be through counsel."</p>

<p>Mr. Odum said to the interpreter, "Mrs. Oswald"&mdash;to the interpreter&mdash;"will
you tell Mrs. Oswald to decide what she would like to do and not listen to her
mother-in-law."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
I said, "It is no good to tell my daughter-in-law, because my daughter-in-law is
not leaving here with you, Mr. Odum, without counsel."</p>

<p>And I had been telling Marina, "No, no."</p>

<p>She said, "I do, Mamma," she kept saying.</p>

<p>Just then my son, Robert, entered the room, and Mr. Odum said, "Robert, we
would like to take Marina and question her."</p>

<p>He said, "No, I am sorry, we are going to try to get lawyers for both she and
Lee."</p>

<p>So he left.</p>

<p>We went to the courthouse and we sat and sat, and while at the courthouse
my son, Robert, was being interviewed by&mdash;I don't know whether it was Secret
Service or FBI agents&mdash;in a glass enclosure. We were sitting&mdash;an office, a glass
enclosed office. We were sitting on the bench right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the Dallas courthouse, on Saturday.</p>

<p>So we waited quite a while. One of the men came by and said "I am sorry
that we are going to be delayed in letting you see Lee, but we have picked up
another suspect."</p>

<p>I said, to Marina, "Oh, Marina, good, another man they think maybe shoot
Kennedy."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask anything about who this suspect was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. He just give the information why we would
be delayed. We sat out there quite a while. The police were very nice. They
helped us about the baby. We went into another room for privacy, for Marina
to nurse Rachel. It was 2 or 3 hours before we got to see Lee. We went upstairs
and were allowed to see Lee. This was in the jail&mdash;the same place I had
been from the very beginning, and we were taken upstairs. And by the way,
they only issued a pass for Marina and myself, and not for Robert. And Robert
was very put out, because he thought he was also going to see his brother.
Whether Robert saw his brother or not, I do not know, Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what time of day was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Just a minute now. We arrived there at 12 o'clock. This would
be about 4 or 4:30 in the afternoon, before we got to see Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anyone else present when he saw you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Marina and I were escorted back of the door where they
had an enclosure and telephones. So Marina got on the telephone and talked to
Lee in Russian. That is my handicap. I don't know what was said. And Lee
seemed very severely composed and assured. He was well-beaten up. He had
black eyes, and his face was all bruised and everything. But he was very calm.
He smiled with his wife, and talked with her, and then I got on the phone and I
said, "Honey, you are so bruised up, your face. What are they doing?"</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, don't worry. I got that in a scuffle."</p>

<p>Now, my son would not tell me they had abused him. That was a boy's way
to his mother&mdash;if he was abused, and it was shown in the paper his black eyes&mdash;he
wouldn't tell how he got that. He said that was done in the scuffle. So
I talked and said, "Is there anything I can do to help you?"</p>

<p>He said, "No, Mother, everything is fine. I know my rights, and I will have
an attorney. I have already requested to get in touch with Attorney Abt, I
think is the name. Don't worry about a thing."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to him about another suspect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not. That was my entire conversation to him.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, you must realize this. I had heard over the television my son
say, "I did not do it. I did not do it."</p>

<p>And a million of the other people had heard him. I say this. As a mother&mdash;I
heard my son say this. But also as a citizen, if I had heard another man
say, I didn't do it, I will have to believe that man, because he hasn't been&mdash;hasn't
had the opportunity to present his side of the case. So here is my son.
When I saw him people had said, "Did you ask him if he did it?"</p>

<p>No, sir. I think by now you know my temperament, gentlemen. I would not
insult my son and ask him if he shot at President Kennedy. Why? Because I
myself heard him say, "I didn't do it, I didn't do it."</p>

<p>So, that was enough for me, I would not ask that question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who told you that there was&mdash;they had found another suspect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One of the officers. That, sir, I don't know. He just walked
in real fast while we were sitting down and said they had picked up another
suspect, and it was in the paper that they had picked up another suspect at
that particular time, which would have been approximately 1 o'clock that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you don't remember the officer's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, that is all he said and he left. He was just relaying
why we would be delayed. But it was also published. I do not have the paper
or the information. But I do know from the reporters, when I told my story,
that part to them&mdash;they said that substantiates the newspaper story that they
did pick up a suspect at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About how long did you and Marina spend there with your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say I spent about 3 or 4 minutes on the telephone, and
then Marina came back to the telephone and talked with Lee. So we left. So
Marina started crying. Marina says, "Mamma, I tell Lee I love Lee and Lee
says he love me very much. And Lee tell me to make sure I buy shoes for
June."</p>

<p>Now, here is a man that is accused of the murder of a President. This is
the next day, or let's say about 24 hours that he has been questioned. His
composure is good. And he is thinking about his young daughter needing shoes.</p>

<p>Now, June was wearing shoes belonging to Mrs. Paine's little girl, Marina
told me&mdash;they were little red tennis shoes, and the top was worn. They were
clean, and the canvas was showing by the toe part, like children wear out their
toes.</p>

<p>I ask you this, gentlemen. If Marina had a hundred and some odd dollars
in the house, why is it necessary that my son has to tell her at the jailhouse,
remind her to buy shoes for his baby, for their child? Just a few dollars out
of that hundred and some odd dollars would have bought shoes for this
particular child.</p>

<p>Another way to look at this, as I stated previously&mdash;that the boy is concerned
about shoes for his baby, and he is in this awful predicament. So he
must feel innocent, or sure that everything is going to be all right, as he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, in this telephone conversation, when you talked to your
son, can you explain a little bit to the Commission how that is? Was your
son on the other side of a wall or something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. My son was on the other side of the wall, and then
back of the wall was a door with a peephole, where an officer was.</p>

<p>Now, we are going to come from the door, with the peephole and the officer,
to my son. Then a glass partition and then glass partitions like telephone
booths. But not really inclosed&mdash;just a little separation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So you could not reach in there and take your son's hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. We talked by telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And he had a telephone on his side, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And he had a telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you talked back and forth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Back and forth, that is right. That is the way we talked. And
the boy was badly beat up. I have proof in the papers&mdash;his face, black eyes,
all scratched up, his neck was scratched. He was badly beat up. But he
assured me they were not mistreating him, that he got some of the bruises in
the scuffle. As I say, the boy, if he was being mistreated, would not tell his
mother that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And whatever Marina said to him was in Russian, and you didn't
understand it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not understand. But I would say this, it seemed
to be just an ordinary pleasant conversation. He was smiling. And she told
me he said he loved her very much, she said she loved him, and told about
buying the shoes for the baby. That is all she said. She did not tell me any
other part of the conversation. And they talked quite a while. She talked
with him twice. She talked with him the first time. I got on the phone. Then
she talked to him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did it sound like there was any dispute or argument?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. It was a pleasant conversation. But she did not volunteer
to tell me what was said, and I did not ask her what was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. So then after that we went back to the Adolphus Hotel. And
upon arriving at the hotel&mdash;I am a little ahead of my story.</p>

<p>The police and the detectives at the Dallas jail were most courteous to
Marina and I. There were hundreds of reporters out in the corridor. And
we were getting ready to leave, so they said that they would take us down the
back way&mdash;incidentally, the same place where my son was shot. And they had
arranged for two to go down and to get a car and to bring into this basement,
and take us down the back elevator, and try to avoid the reporters. And there
were approximately six or seven in the elevator. When we got down there,
there were just a few reporters, and they went way out of their way to elude
any reporters. We were at the Adolphus Hotel as I explained to you. And
instead of from the jail going straight to the Adolphus Hotel, they drove
around 20 or 25 minutes time in circles in order to lose anybody who might
be following Marina and I.</p>

<p>So, as we got to the floor of the Adolphus Hotel, we knocked on the door
where we were, and no one answered. We were with two men. Immediately
around the corner comes Mr. Tommy Thompson, the Life representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What two men were you with?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two men from the Dallas courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. From the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, from the police.</p>

<p>So Mr. Tommy Thompson came and they asked for his credentials. I had
never even&mdash;as thorough as I am trying to be&mdash;I am trying to tell you there are
some things I don't know because of the confusion&mdash;I didn't ask for the credentials.
I could have been with anybody. I just assumed they were Life
representatives. I had not asked. But these Dallas detectives or police, in
plain clothes, asked Mr. Tommy Thompson for his credentials, and then left
us in his care again.</p>

<p>Immediately Mr. Tommy Thompson said, "Mrs. Oswald, what do you plan
to do now?"</p>

<p>The interpreter was gone, and so was the other representative, Mr. Allen
Grant.</p>

<p>I said, "Well, the arrangement was that we were going to stay here in the
hotel for a few days, and you were going to pay expenses."</p>

<p>He said, "But you have not given us any facts."</p>

<p>They were not interested&mdash;and to me it seems very strange that they were
not interested in my conversation at the jail with my son. They did not even
ask if we saw Lee. Yet they knew we left the Adolphus Hotel in order to go
see Lee. But they did not even ask if we saw Lee. And I have often wondered
about that.</p>

<p>So when I told him that we expected to stay there, he said, "Well, Mrs.
Oswald, the reporters will be coming in flocks, they know where you are. Just
a minute."</p>

<p>He got on the telephone. Mr. Allen Grant&mdash;they had a Life&mdash;the Life representatives
had a room on the ninth floor where they had a lot of men working
on this case, and we were on the 11th, I believe. So Mr. Allen Grant came down
from the ninth floor with another man&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash;because the
baby's diapers had to be changed and things of this sort. He said, "Mrs.
Oswald"&mdash;they left. Tommy Thompson said, "Mrs. Oswald, what we are going
to do is get you on the outskirts of town, so the reporters won't know where
you are, and here is some money for your expenses in case you need anything."</p>

<p>Well, I took the bill, and I put it in my uniform pocket without looking at it.
That may sound strange to you gentlemen, but this is confusion. I knew it was
money, and I just put it in my uniform pocket.</p>

<p>So Mr. Allen Grant escorted my daughter-in-law and I out of the hotel, the
Adolphus Hotel, and took us to the Executive Inn, which is on the outskirts of
Dallas. We sat in the car. He went in and came out, then, and said, "Mrs.
Oswald, I have arranged for you all to stay here for 2 or 3 days. I have to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
back in San Francisco. Anything you want you have your cash that Mr.
Tommy Thompson gave you. And he will be in touch with you."</p>

<p>Well, I didn't think too much of it. He escorted us with a porter up to
our room.</p>

<p>We had two beautiful suites&mdash;two, not one&mdash;completed rooms and baths,
adjoining, at the Executive Inn. And that was the last time I had seen either
representative. I was stranded with a Russian girl and two babies. I didn't
realize in the beginning. But then it was time for food, and I had to order
food. I told Marina to stay aside and that I would let the man in. She stayed
in her room. I let this man in with the food, and then I became uneasy, that he
might know who we were is what I was uneasy about, because I didn't realize
the danger actually Marina and I were in.</p>

<p>I sensed we were alone. And there I was with a Russian girl. And I didn't
want anybody to know who we were, because I knew my son had been picked up.</p>

<p>So this is where the picture comes in.</p>

<p>While there, Marina&mdash;there is an ashtray on the dressing table. And Marina
comes with bits of paper, and puts them in the ashtray and strikes a match to it.
And this is the picture of the gun that Marina tore up into bits of paper, and
struck a match to it.</p>

<p>Now, that didn't burn completely, because it was heavy&mdash;not cardboard&mdash;what
is the name for it&mdash;a photographic picture. So the match didn't take it
completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you said anything to her about burning it before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. The last time I had seen the picture was in Marina's
shoe when she was trying to tell me that the picture was in her shoe. I state
here now that Marina meant for me to have that picture, from the very beginning,
in Mrs. Paine's home. She said&mdash;I testified before&mdash;"Mamma, you keep
picture."</p>

<p>And then she showed it to me in the courthouse. And when I refused it,
then she decided to get rid of the picture.</p>

<p>She tore up the picture and struck a match to it. Then I took it and flushed
it down the toilet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what time was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This&mdash;now, just a minute, gentlemen, because this I know is
very important to me and to you, too.</p>

<p>We had been in the jail. This was an evening. Well, this, then, would be
approximately 5:30 or 6 in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Saturday, November 23. Now, I flushed the torn bits and
the half-burned thing down the commode. And nothing was said. There was
nothing said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was at the Executive Inn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Executive Inn.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Hart Odum, the same FBI agent, that insisted upon my daughter-in-law
going with him from the Adolphus Hotel, knocked on the door at the
Executive Inn. I had had my robe and slippers on, and I pushed the curtain
aside when he knocked. He said, "This is Mr. Odum."</p>

<p>So, I opened the door. This is very important. I would like to not talk about
it. I would like to show you what I did. This is so important.</p>

<p>I opened the door just a little, because I had the robe off and I didn't want
anybody to come in. The door is just ajar. I am going to take my shoes off,
gentlemen, because I have this worked out. This is my height. He said,
"Mrs. Oswald, we would like to see Marina."</p>

<p>I said, "Mr. Odum, I stated yesterday you are not going to see Marina.
We are awful tired."</p>

<p>"Well, we just want to ask her one question."</p>

<p>"Mr. Odum, I am not calling my daughter. As a matter of fact, she is
taking a bath."</p>

<p>She wasn't.</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Oswald, I would like to ask you a question."</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, sir." The door is ajar. This is my height. I wear bifocals,
which enlarges things. And in his hand&mdash;his hand is bigger than mine&mdash;in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
cup of his hand, like this, is a picture. And the two corners are torn off the
picture. This is a very glossy black and white picture of a man's face and
shoulder.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Odum wasn't too tall. I need somebody else. Mr. Odum's hand
with the picture&mdash;what I am trying to say&mdash;he is facing this way&mdash;showing me.
So my eyes are looking straight at the picture. And I have nothing else to see
but this hand and the picture, because the door is ajar. And there is nothing on
the picture but a face and shoulders. There is no background or anything.
So I can identify this picture amongst millions of pictures, I am so sure of it.
It was a glossy black and white picture. So I said, "No, sir, believe me. I have
never seen this picture in my life."</p>

<p>With that, he went off.</p>

<p>There was another man with him.</p>

<p>About an hour later the telephone rang, and it was Mrs. Paine. She said,
"Mrs. Oswald, Lee called and he was very upset because Marina was not with
me, and he asked me to get a lawyer for him, a Mr. Abt. I would like to talk
to Marina."</p>

<p>So I put Marina on the telephone, and Marina said about two or three words.</p>

<p>So when she got off the telephone, I said,&mdash;Now, Marina talks in Russian,
gentlemen. I said, "Marina, Mrs. Paine told me that Lee called and you were
not home at Mrs. Paine, and Lee tells Mrs. Paine to get a lawyer."</p>

<p>Marina didn't answer.</p>

<p>And I then sensed&mdash;well, now, why isn't she answering me? This is very
peculiar.</p>

<p>And there was no more said about that conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask her about this lawyer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ask Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. There was no more said about this conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You didn't say anything about Mr. Abt to her then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. But here is the point to this whole thing.</p>

<p>The FBI agent would have to know where we were, and Mrs. Paine would
have to know where we were, because of these two Life representatives, who, I
am assuming, probably went back to Mrs. Paine's home in order to get more
information. And she&mdash;they would have told her where we were, because no
one knew where we were. This girl and I had no protection or anything. We
were sent out there with this Mr. Allen Grant, the representative. And no one
knew who we were. And Mr. Hart Odum would have to know where we were
through Mrs. Paine, which is a normal procedure, let's say. He might have
gone to Mrs. Paine's home looking for Marina there, and Mrs. Paine might have
told him we were at the Executive Inn. I will grant that.</p>

<p>But the point I am going to make is that the picture was tried to be shown to
Marina before the telephone conversation.</p>

<p>Now, if there are any questions why I say that, I would be happy to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes&mdash;why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because they wanted <span class="locked">Marina&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we get what picture this is? Is that the picture held in
the hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;the picture that is held in the hand, that the FBI
agent, Mr. Hart Odum showed me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I understand you didn't recognize who the picture was at all.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I told Mr. Hart Odum I had never seen the man before,
"Believe me, sir," and he left.</p>

<p>So the picture was shown&mdash;was tried&mdash;had tried to be shown to my daughter-in-law,
but they were not successful.</p>

<p>So then they received&mdash;Marina receives a telephone call.</p>

<p>Now, I am under the impression, since I know it was Mr. Jack Ruby's picture
I saw&mdash;at the time I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because I have seen his picture in the paper. Now I know
it is Mr. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>I am under the impression that Marina was <span class="locked">threatened&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the date now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is Saturday, November 23d. This is approximately 6:30
in the evening, that the FBI agent came. And the telephone call was later.</p>

<p>Now, I have no way of knowing whether Lee had permission to use the
telephone. Remember, Lee is in jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what time do you think the telephone call was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say it was about 7:30, 8 o'clock in the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was still on Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, still on Saturday night at the Executive Inn. And
that was after the picture was shown to me&mdash;she received this telephone call,
and became very silent.</p>

<p>And the next day my son was shot.</p>

<p>Now, it is now that I have done investigation of this case that I believe
that the picture was meant for Marina to see, meant for Marina to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why do you think that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because now it has been proven that Jack Ruby killed my son.
And I think there is a connection there. Because Marina did not tell me about
her conversation. And you men hold the answer whether Lee used the telephone
from the jailhouse. I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You base that on just your own conclusion that you arrive
at now, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;because of the FBI agent, Mr. Hart Odum, insistence on
taking my daughter-in-law&mdash;and he being the same agent that came and showed
the picture. And Mr. Ruby being the man that shot Lee&mdash;yes, these are definite
conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is what you base it on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is what I base it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do I understand correctly that Marina did not see the picture
at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir. But they tried awfully hard for Marina
to see the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when they could not show it to <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They showed it to me&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever seen that picture since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On a Wednesday&mdash;Lee was shot on a Sunday&mdash;neither Marina
nor I knew how he was shot. They kept it from us. You have to visualize
this.</p>

<p>We were at the Six Flags with approximately 18 to 20 FBI agents, Secret
Service men running in and out, a woman with a Russian girl and two sick
babies, and the girl and I do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you had gotten over to the Six Flags, you must have
skipped something there&mdash;you were in the Executive Inn before.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I was going to make a point about letting you know
why I didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right&mdash;let's go back to the Executive Inn.</p>

<p>So that night I was very upset and very worried. I realized that we were
there alone. And we were not going to go in town, into Dallas. I wasn't
going to take this Russian girl and the two babies. And the babies were all
chapped. We had no diapers. We were not prepared for this. And it was
hectic, gentlemen.</p>

<p>So all night long I am wondering how can I get in touch with Robert, what
can I do.</p>

<p>And I was a little suspicious of Mrs. Paine. I was suspicious of Mrs. Paine
from the time I entered her home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you found out how much money the Life man gave you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, not even yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. So I signed for the food. I called the operator and I asked
the operator what name the room was registered under. She said, "Well, this
is an unusual request. Don't you know what room&mdash;what name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
I said, "Frankly, I don't. We are three couples. I don't know which name
they used."</p>

<p>So she told me that the room was registered under Mrs. Allen Grant, which
is the name of the Life representative. So I charged and signed. And they
would have that for proof&mdash;Mrs. Allen Grant, on the food.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why did you say three couples?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I just said that to the operator, because I had to give her a
reason why I didn't know which name the room was registered under.</p>

<p>So I just wanted to elaborate a little bit&mdash;let her know. I didn't want
to give my name. Because I was by this time a little concerned about the
situation.</p>

<p>During the night I thought&mdash;"We are in a position here, I am in a position
with a Russian girl and two babies, and I just don't know what to do."</p>

<p>I had no contact with Robert. Robert was trying to get an attorney. And
I didn't know if Robert knew where we were. And I did not want to call Mrs.
Paine. I wanted to stay clear of Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>So this is a very unusual coincidence.</p>

<p>Now, I have to go back a little bit. But, believe me, gentlemen, the story will
get together for you to understand.</p>

<p>About 1 month prior to this, there was an ad in a Fort Worth paper that the
public library was going to have language lessons, and one was Russian classes.</p>

<p>Well, I then, as I told you&mdash;I was employed for the 3 to 11 shift. And I was
getting a day off. And this would have been a steady job because this woman
was not that sick, just an invalid.</p>

<p>So I decided on my day off I wanted to do something. So I decided I would
call up about it, and on my day off&mdash;make Tuesday my day off and take up
Russian in case&mdash;because I had always hoped in my heart that Marina and
Lee would contact me some day. After all, I am a mother first.</p>

<p>So I went to the library. And Mr. Peter Gregory was the instructor.</p>

<p>Now, you must remember&mdash;I did not know that he knew Marina and Lee.
This is public notice for the Russian language.</p>

<p>So Mr. Peter Gregory is the instructor.</p>

<p>I went to the second class. My car broke down just one block from the
library, and I had to have it towed, and I went to the class. And Mr. Peter
Gregory was there, and several of the women waiting for his classes to start.
I said I don't imagine I will learn anything, because my car has broken down
and I am pretty upset. And Mr. Gregory said, "Where do you live, Mrs. Oswald?
Maybe I could help you and take you home." And the other couple said, "We
would be happy."</p>

<p>And I said I live in Arlington Heights. And he happens to live about 10
blocks away.</p>

<p>Now, I have to go back.</p>

<p>The point I am going to make is this: Mr. Peter Gregory is the engineer
who knew my son Robert, who was friends with Lee and Marina. Yet when I
registered for a class, and the librarian had come back down before the class,
and read off the names of the people that were going to take the Spanish lesson,
isn't it peculiar that Mr. Gregory did not remember me as the mother of Lee&mdash;didn't
acknowledge me as the mother of Lee? I find that very peculiar.</p>

<p>Even the second lesson, there was no acknowledgment.</p>

<p>So I went home with Mr. Peter Gregory. And there was still no acknowledgment.</p>

<p>So we were talking about the Russian language, that is is very hard to learn.
And I said, "I am sure I will never master it." And I thought I think I will
tell him why I want to take lessons is because of my Russian daughter-in-law,
and my son speaks Russian. But I didn't do it.</p>

<p>But I am going to point out again that Mr. Gregory did not acknowledge me.</p>

<p>I am going to give and take. Maybe he didn't connect me. But it would
seem very odd&mdash;Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was the name&mdash;that he didn't connect
as Marina's mother-in-law and Lee's mother, when he was such a friend with
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I am not clear as to what lessons you were taking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Russian lessons at the public library in Fort Worth, Tex., and
Mr. Gregory was the teacher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said something about Spanish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, did I? I am sorry. No, sir, the Russian language.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. What days were these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What days were these that you talked to Mr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You mean the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not have this information. But I can get it for you from
the public library, because there was a public notice in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us approximately?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was just right before the assassination. I had taken
two lessons. Yes, I had taken two lessons, and then I didn't go for the third
lesson, because this was on a Friday&mdash;the lessons were on a Tuesday. So I had
taken two lessons, the two Tuesdays prior to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>So it would be around a little over 3 weeks before the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Two Tuesdays before, and then my next lesson would
have been the Tuesday after the Friday of the assassination.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, that is the time.</p>

<p>So then I thought of Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>Now, believe me, gentlemen&mdash;and I will swear again, if you want me to&mdash;nothing
was said about Mr. Gregory and Marina being friends. But I do have
a guardian angel. And, as I go along, some of the things I know have been
from this guardian angel.</p>

<p>This was just a coincidence.</p>

<p>I thought of calling Mr. Peter Gregory. I have no friends in Fort Worth.
I never&mdash;I live a very lonely life. I am not lonely. But I live to myself. I am
kept very busy. I had my work, 24 hour duty. So really I have no friends.
And because of Lee's defection, I didn't make any new friends.</p>

<p>So I am racking my mind who can I call for help. And I think of Mr. Peter
Gregory. So I call Mr. Peter Gregory at 6:30 in the morning, Sunday, the
24th&mdash;Sunday morning the 24th.</p>

<p>And I didn't want the hotel operator to know who I was. So I gave a fictitious
name. He said, "I am sorry,"&mdash;I said, "I can't tell you who I am, Mr.
Gregory."</p>

<p>I am ahead of my story.</p>

<p>Marina, when I said, "Marina, we need help, honey. I am going to call a
Mr. Gregory."</p>

<p>And I told her about me taking Russian lessons.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mama, I know Mr. Gregory, Lee know Mr. Gregory, the man at the
library that gives Russian lessons."</p>

<p>So I find that very much of a coincidence.</p>

<p>So I called Mr. Gregory. I said, "Mr. Gregory, I won't say who I am, but
you know my son and you know my daughter-in-law, and I am in trouble, sir.
I am over here."</p>

<p>He said, "I am sorry, but I won't talk to anybody I don't know."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What name did you give him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't give him any name.</p>

<p>He said, "I am sorry, but I won't talk to anyone I don't know."</p>

<p>And I said again, "Well, you know my son real well."</p>

<p>He said, "Oh, you are Mrs. Oswald."</p>

<p>I said, "Yes sir, this is Mrs. Oswald. We are at the Executive Inn in Dallas,
stranded. And do you know of anyone who would give my daughter-in-law and
I a home, and put us up for the time that this is going on, so we can be near Lee
at the courthouse? I need help. Mr. Gregory."</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Oswald, what is your room number? I will help you. Hold
still. Help will be coming."</p>

<p>And so that was the end of my conversation with Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>At 11:30 Sunday, November 23d, my son Robert and Mr. Gregory came to the
Executive Inn, all excited. We had diapers strung all over the place. My
uniform was washed. I had no clothes with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
I went with the uniform.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, we have got to get you out of here."</p>

<p>I am not one to be told what to do, and you gentlemen know that by this time.
I said, "What's your hurry? We have the diapers and all. I want to tell you
what happened."</p>

<p>"Mother, Mother stop talking. We have to get you out of here."</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory said, "Mrs. Oswald, will you listen and get things together. We
have to get you out of here."</p>

<p>I said, "That is all we have been doing since yesterday, running from one place
to the other. Give us just a minute. We are coming, but we have to pack
things."</p>

<p>"Hurry up."</p>

<p>I said, "I want you to know how we got here. I was shown a picture of a man
last night. And Mrs. Paine called and said that Lee called."</p>

<p>I told him exactly.</p>

<p>So Mr. Gregory and Robert knew about the things I told you. I told him that
while I am gathering up the things.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Oswald, we will talk later. We have to get you out of here."</p>

<p>I have found out since that my son was shot. But they did not tell us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have a television in this room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, here is another Godsend. We watched the television, Marina and I.
She watched more than I did. We were very busy, Mr. Rankin. The babies
had diarrhea and everything. I was very busy with the babies and the Russian
girl. And just like at the end of the Six Flags, we were just getting snatches of
it. But Marina wanted to know, "Mama, I want see Lee." She was hoping
Lee would come on the picture, like he did. So this morning, Sunday morning,
I said, "Oh, honey, let's turn the television off. The same thing over and over."</p>

<p>And I turned the television off. So Marina and I did not see what happened
to my son.</p>

<p>We had the television off.</p>

<p>So we did not know.</p>

<p>But frantically Robert and Mr. Gregory kept insisting that we pack and run.</p>

<p>So when we get downstairs, here was Secret Service men all over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, before you leave that, what did Robert say about the story
about the picture, when you told him that? Did he say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. He and Mr. Gregory both didn't want to listen to me. I
told them, but they didn't want to hear my story. They wanted to get us out
of here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They didn't say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not that I can recall. And I don't believe they did.
They didn't want to hear what I had to say. They kept fussing at me and
saying "Mother, stop talking. Hurry up, we have got to get you out of here."</p>

<p>I kept saying, "All we have been doing is run from one place to the other. The
diapers are wet."</p>

<p>I was kind of having my way about this.</p>

<p>So when we get downstairs, there is Secret Service all around.</p>

<p>I am ahead of my story.</p>

<p>Robert went downstairs to pay the bill, and that is when I gave Robert the
money, and it was a $50 bill that the Life representative had given to me. They
gave me some money. I took it <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the first time you looked at it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first time I looked at it, sir. I charged the food, and I
had no need for money. Wait a minute&mdash;I am wrong. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mrs. Oswald&mdash;didn't you say you had washed your
uniform?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you washed your uniform, didn't <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Just a minute, if you let me explain. I just said I was wrong.
The first time&mdash;it was Puerto Rican that brought the dinner in. We needed
baby lotion for the baby. And then I took the bill out and I saw it was a $50
bill, because he went to the drug store&mdash;I gave him the $50 bill, this Puerto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Rican, that brought the food in&mdash;the first food we had&mdash;to go to the drug
store and pay for the necessities that Marina and I needed&mdash;really it was for
the baby, the lotion and everything. And he came back and the drug store
was closed&mdash;it was on a Sunday. And so I did know about the $50 bill before
this time.</p>

<p>And then when Robert came, I gave Robert the $50 bill and he went downstairs
to pay the bill.</p>

<p>Now, the representatives had not paid the bill. Robert used the $50 to
pay the bill. The bill was not paid. So we were really stranded. Those men
left two women stranded.</p>

<p>Now, let me see if there is anything I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you put the $50 after the Puerto Rican brought it
back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In my uniform pocket, because that was all the clothes I had.
I kept it in my pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you washed your <span class="locked">uniform&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I naturally took it out of my pocket to wash my uniform, because
I stated I gave Robert the $50 bill to pay the hotel. But that was all the
clothes I had. You have to visualize that all of this is really rush business.
We are doing all this in a hurry.</p>

<p>So I didn't even put it in my pocketbook. And I would not be the type to
put it in my pocketbook, because it is a $50 bill and all the money I have to
get out of the hotel&mdash;I don't know if I am going to get help&mdash;so I want to keep
it on my person, just like I keep my important papers right now on my person.</p>

<p>I took it out of my pocket to wash the uniform, I know. This can be proven
by the bellhop who brought the food. And he went to the drug store, and
the drug store was closed on Sunday. And we did not get the lotion. And I
gave him the $50 bill to buy the things with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then after you paid the bill <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Robert paid the bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What happened next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing was said about the bill. I didn't know then that the
representatives had not paid the bill. Robert took the $50 and checked us out.
Then the Secret <span class="locked">Service&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we have the time when you checked out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;approximately 11:30 to 12 o'clock, on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us the amount of the bill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Since then I have called Robert and Robert said the
amount of the bill was 40-some-odd dollars&mdash;about $48, I believe. That is what
Robert told me. I have no way of knowing, otherwise than what Robert told me.</p>

<p>And I would think so. If I remember correctly the rooms were $17.50. I
told you before that they put us in exclusive suites, and two. And the rooms
were $17.50. And we had some meals. So that would make it about 40-some-odd
dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then after Robert checked you out, what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then Robert got in a car with Secret Service, and then Marina
and I and Mr. Gregory were in another car, with two Secret Service agents in the
front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you go someplace?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Here comes me again. They wanted to take us&mdash;as soon as
we got in the car Mr. Gregory says, "We are taking you to Robert's mother-in-law's
house."</p>

<p>Now, they live out of Boyd, Tex., in the country. Boyd, Tex., is a little
bit of country town. But they live in a little farm house. They are dairy
people&mdash;Robert's in-laws. And they wanted to take us there, which would have
been approximately 45 miles from Dallas.</p>

<p>And I said, "No, you are not taking me out in the sticks, in the country.
I want to be in Dallas where I can help Lee."</p>

<p>"Well, for security reasons, this is the best place. Nobody would ever find it."</p>

<p>I said, "Security reasons? You can give security for me in a hotel room in
town. I am not going out in this little country town. I want to be in Dallas
where I can help Lee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
And so I am not being well liked, because all the arrangements was made,
that we were going to go to this little farm house. But I would not go.</p>

<p>I could not survive if I was 40 or 50 miles away and my son was picked up as
a murderer. I had to be right there in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, this was <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When they left the Executive Inn, when we got in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And this was after your son was killed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, yes, but they didn't know this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And Robert didn't know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They kept it from us&mdash;I guess being women. Marina and I
did not even know he was shot.</p>

<p>I will go on to that story and tell you. No, sir, we did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The Secret Service people didn't tell you either?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; nothing was said. They wanted us for security <span class="locked">reasons&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If the time is <span class="locked">11:30&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They left at 12 or 12:30, I thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You said 11:30 to 12.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It might not have taken place.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know Lee was shot. But at this time I am telling you I
don't know this.</p>

<p>This has to go in sequence, sir. Lee was shot, or else we wouldn't have had
all these Secret Service men around. But I know then after that Lee was shot.
Not now&mdash;I do not know this.</p>

<p>Are there any questions? I am willing to answer anything you want to ask.</p>

<p>If you will bear with me, I can go <span class="locked">into&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you later learn at what time of that Sunday he was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You never did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not until about 3 days later. That is what I was telling
you about Six Flags. I am trying to explain to you why I don't know these
things is because we did not sit down and watch television and read papers.
Marina and I&mdash;I had two sick babies there. There was a doctor coming in
twice a day. I was a very busy woman. And the men were not telling us
anything. They were not interested in us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, after you told them that you wanted to stay in a hotel,
you could be protected there, what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then, of course, nothing was said that they were going to give
me my way. But we needed clothes&mdash;Marina and the baby needed clothes. So
then they decided that they should go to Irving, through my suggestion and so
on, and pick up clothes for Marina and the baby, because we were short on
diapers. So they are going to Irving.</p>

<p>We got to Irving. There is police cars all around. So that is why I feel
sure my son was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How far away is that from this Executive Inn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would think&mdash;now, this is just hearsay. But I would think
it is about 12 to 15 or 18 miles.</p>

<p>When we reached there, they brought us to the chief of police's home. And
there were cars all around.</p>

<p>As soon as the car stopped, the Secret Service agent said, "Lee has been shot."</p>

<p>And I said, "How badly?"</p>

<p>He said, "In the shoulder."</p>

<p>They brought Marina into the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask him how he knew that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It came over&mdash;I thought he had the radio in the car, Secret
Serviceman, and he had talked to someone. This was all set up, sir, and I can
prove to you. They didn't want us to know. They are now telling us this,
Marina and I.</p>

<p>He talked, and then he turned around and said, "Lee has been shot."</p>

<p>I said, "How badly?"</p>

<p>He said, "In the shoulder."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
I cried, and said, "Marina, Lee has been shot."</p>

<p>So Marina went into the chief of police's at Irving home, to call Mrs. Paine,
to get the diapers and things ready. They decided and told us, with me in the
car and Marina, that it would not be a good thing for us to go to Mrs. Paine's
home and get these things, that Marina should go in the chief of police's home
and call and tell Mrs. Paine what she wanted.</p>

<p>And one or two of the agents would go and get the things for Marina.</p>

<p>So I am sitting in the car with the agent. Marina is in the home now&mdash;remember.</p>

<p>So something comes over the mike, and the Secret Service agent says, "Do not
repeat. Do not repeat."</p>

<p>I said, "My son is gone isn't he?"</p>

<p>And he didn't answer.</p>

<p>I said, "Answer me. I want to know. If my son is gone, I want to meditate."</p>

<p>He said, "Yes, Mrs. Oswald, your son has just expired."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, which agent told you this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the agent that was also now sent to me to protect me
in Fort Worth, Tex.&mdash;Mr. Mike Howard, who was the agent that rode in the
car with President Johnson, who was the agent that was at Six Flags, that
was in charge, who was the agent that was assigned to protect Baine Johnson
at the dormitory. He is also the same agent that was sent to protect me in
Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, who was the other agent that was with you that day?
Was there another Secret Service agent with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He went into the home&mdash;he escorted Marina into the chief of
police's home, and I do not know his name. And he is not the other agent that I
want to know the name of.</p>

<p>Wait just a minute.</p>

<p>I don't know this man's name. But he is not the other agent that is involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, about what time on that Sunday did you learn of your
son's death?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, here is your time element. I said Robert and Mr.
Gregory and the Secret Service were there approximately from 11:30. And I
knew nothing about the shooting. And then we had to go to Irving and everything.
Then they told us Lee was shot. So now we are bringing up to the
time&mdash;it all fits in&mdash;which was 1 o'clock or 1:30.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, then when I got the news, I went into the home, and I
said, "Marina, our boy is gone."</p>

<p>We both cried. And they were all watching the sequence on television. The
television was turned to the back, where Marina and I could not see it. They
sat us on the sofa, and his wife gave us coffee. And the back of the television
was to us. And the men and all, a lot of men were looking at the television.
It probably just happened, because the man said, "Do not repeat." And I
insisted.</p>

<p>They gave us coffee.</p>

<p>And then it later came out in the paper that&mdash;a story about the chief of
police, how it was set up for the women, that we should not know.</p>

<p>We were to go to his house. There was a story about that from this chief of
police of Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What paper is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The Star Telegram paper.</p>

<p>All of my papers were taken out of my home by Secret Service men. While
at Six Flags, they saved the papers for me. We would not let the maids take
the papers. And I brought all of those papers from the Six Flags, from the
very beginning, to my home in Fort Worth, Tex. And every piece of paper out
of my home was taken. So I did not&mdash;believe me, gentlemen, this seems strange,
but it was 2 weeks later before I saw the picture of the way my son was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair Justice of the Star Telegram gave me the back issues of papers.
And it wasn't until then that I actually knew the tragedy, how my son was shot.
Because they took all the papers, all my clippings and everything. I was left
stranded, without any papers. And until Mr. Blair Justice brought me these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
back issues, some 2 weeks later, was the first time that I saw exactly the tragic
way my son was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any discussion between you and Marina about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. We didn't know. I was with Marina at the Executive Inn
from the 22d until the shooting, the 24th&mdash;as I told you.</p>

<p>Then we left. And from the 24th to the 28th, at the Inn of the Six Flags, the
agents and my son kept this from us. We did not know. We knew Lee was
shot and dead. But we didn't know how. We didn't get to read a paper or
watch television. We just had snatches of the television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, when you both learned that he was shot on that Sunday
afternoon, did you and Marina say anything to each other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes. That is another story.</p>

<p>Immediately I said, "I want to see Lee." And Marina said, "I want see
Lee, too."</p>

<p>And the chief of police and Mr. Gregory said, "Well, it would be better to
wait until he was at the funeral home and fixed up."</p>

<p>I said, "No, I want to see Lee now."</p>

<p>Marina said, "Me, too, me want to see Lee."</p>

<p>They led us to believe that now they have taught her to do like this. But
Marina has always spoken like that. I have acted as an interpreter for her, as
I stated before, for an FBI agent. And she understood me. And he was satisfied
that he didn't need an interpreter.</p>

<p>So she said, "I want to see Lee, too."</p>

<p>They didn't want us to see Lee, from the ugliness of it evidently. But I insisted,
and so did Marina. So they could not do anything about it with the
two women. So they decided to pacify us.</p>

<p>We got in the car. On the way in the car they are trying to get us to change
our minds. And he said, Mr. Mike Howard&mdash;he was driving the car&mdash;"Mrs.
Oswald for security reasons it would be much better if you would wait until
later on to see Lee because this is a big thing."</p>

<p>I said, "For security reasons I want you to know that I am an American
citizen, and even though I am poor I have as much right as any other human
being, and Mrs. Kennedy was escorted to the hospital to see her husband. And
I insist upon being escorted, and enough security to take me to the hospital to
see my son."</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I require the same privilege.</p>

<p>So Mr. Mike Howard said, "All right, we will take you to the hospital.</p>

<p>"I want you to know when we get there we will not be able to protect you.
Our security measures end right there. The police will then have you under
protection. We cannot protect you."</p>

<p>I said, "That is fine. If I am to die, I will die that way. But I am going
to see my son."</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory says&mdash;and in the most awful tone of voice, I will always remember this&mdash;remember,
gentlemen, my son has been accused, I have just lost a son.</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Oswald, you are being so selfish. You are endangering this
girl's life, and the life of these two children."</p>

<p>I want to elaborate on this. He is not thinking about me. He is thinking
about the Russian girl. I am going to bring this over and over&mdash;that these
Russian people are always considering this Russian girl. He snapped at me.</p>

<p>I said, "Mr. Gregory, I am not talking for my daughter-in-law. She can do
what she wants. I am saying I want to see my son."</p>

<p>And so they brought us to the hospital. And Marina said, "I too want to see
Lee."</p>

<p>After Mr. Gregory said that&mdash;"I, too, want to see Lee."</p>

<p>So then they did leave us at the entrance of the hospital, the Secret Service
men, and then the police took over. We were escorted by the police in the
hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I would not think it would be more than between 2 and
3 o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Sunday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sunday, November 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Then Mr. Perry, the doctor, came down. We were escorted into
a room. And he came in. He said, "Now, you know the Texas law is that we
have to have an autopsy on a body."</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, I understand."</p>

<p>And Marina understood.</p>

<p>Marina is a registered pharmacist.</p>

<p>So Marina understands these things. And Marina understood.</p>

<p>And he said, "Now, I will do whatever you ladies wish. I understand that
you wish to see the body. However, I will say this. It will not be pleasant.
All the blood has drained from him, and it would be much better if you would
see him after he was fixed up."</p>

<p>I said, "I am a nurse. I have seen death before. I want to see my son now."</p>

<p>Marina&mdash;as I am trying to say, she understands English&mdash;she said, "I want to
see Lee, too." So she knew what the doctor was saying.</p>

<p>We were escorted upstairs into a room. They said it was a morgue, but it
wasn't. Lee's body was on a hospital bed, I would say, or a table&mdash;a table like
you take into an operating room. And there were a lot of policemen standing
around, guarding the body. And, of course, his face was showing. And Marina
went first. She opened his eyelids. Now, to me&mdash;I am a nurse, and I don't
think I could have done that. This is a very, very strong girl, that she can
open a dead man's eyelids. And she says, "He cry. He eye wet." To the
doctor. And the doctor said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Well, I know that the fluid leaves, and you do have moisture. So I didn't even
touch Lee. I just wanted to see that it was my son.</p>

<p>So on the way, leaving the body in the room&mdash;I am in the <span class="locked">room&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You were satisfied it was your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. That is why I wanted to see the body. I wanted to
make sure it was my son.</p>

<p>So while leaving the room, I said to the police&mdash;"I think some day you will
hang your heads in shame."</p>

<p>I said, "I happen to know, and know some facts, that maybe this is the unsung
hero of this episode. And I, as his mother, intend to provide this if I can."</p>

<p>And, with that, I left the room.</p>

<p>Then we were escorted into a room downstairs, and introduced to the chaplain.
I have asked several reporters to give me the chaplain's name, because I wanted
to have all this information for you. But you have to realize I just knew Thursday.
And I have three times as many papers as I have here. So it has been
a chore for me to do all of this. But that is easy to find out&mdash;the name of the
chaplain at Parkland Hospital. So I asked to speak to the chaplain in private.
So I spoke to the chaplain in private, and I told him that I thought my son was
an agent, and that I wanted him to talk to Robert. Robert does not listen to
me, never has, and I have had very, very little conversation with Robert, ever
since Robert has joined the Marines, because of the way our life has intervened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell the chaplain why you thought your son was an
agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, but this is what I told the chaplain. No&mdash;I am always
thinking of my country, the security of my country before I would say anything
like that.</p>

<p>And I told you why I told the FBI men, because of the money involved, and
I didn't know how the public would take this, because they helped a Marxist.</p>

<p>So I didn't tell him. But I did say I wanted him to talk to Robert, because
we financially were in very poor straits. And then I wanted my son buried in
the Arlington Cemetery.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, I didn't know that President Kennedy was going to be buried
in Arlington Cemetery. All I know is that my son is an agent, and that he
deserves to be buried in Arlington Cemetery. So I talked to the chaplain about
this. I went into quite detail about this. I asked him if he would talk to
Robert, because when I talked to Robert about it, as soon as I started to say
something he would say, "Oh, Mother, forget it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
So I asked the chaplain to talk to Robert about Lee being buried in the Arlington
Cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he report to you about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. But he did call Robert in. We were getting ready.
The police were getting ready to escort us out of his office, and he said, "If you
don't mind, I would like to talk to Robert Oswald just a minute."</p>

<p>So he brought Robert into the room he had taken me, and stayed in there a
little while with Robert. So I feel sure that the chaplain relayed my message
to him, because we were getting ready to leave, and he asked the police if he
could talk to Robert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The chaplain never told you anything more about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not seen the chaplain since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Robert say anything about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, Robert says nothing. I have tried to contact Robert
for important matters, and Robert will not talk.</p>

<p>Lee was left handed. Lee wrote left handed and ate right handed. And I
wanted to know if Lee shot left handed. Because on Lee's leaves, as I stated,
they live out in the country, and Robert goes squirrel hunting, and all kinds of
hunting. And on leaves from the Marines, Lee has gone out to this farmhouse,
to Robert's family house, and he and his brother have gone squirrel hunting.
And so Robert would know if Lee shot left handed, and he would not give me
the information, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is Robert left handed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Robert is left handed. I am left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is John Pic left handed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, John is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you are?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Now, I write left handed, but I do everything else with my right hand.</p>

<p>But Lee was more left handed than I am.</p>

<p>I write left handed, but I do everything else with my right hand. But Lee
was left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was Lee Oswald's father left handed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That I do not remember, Mr. Rankin. No&mdash;I am the left
handed one. I would say no.</p>

<p>Now, there is another story. And we have stories galore, believe me&mdash;with
documents and everything.</p>

<p>A gun will be involved in this story, that Lee had bought. But I don't want
to confuse the committee. That is another part that we will have to go into,
that I will have to lead up to. The only way I can do this and not forget
things is to do the way I am doing it. And if you have any questions, if you
feel the story I have told so far&mdash;I would like to know, myself, if I have forgotten
anything.</p>

<p>It is awfully hard for me to remember everything.   If you want to question
me, I am more than happy, if I know the facts, to give them to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, you go ahead and tell us in your own way.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have some fresh water, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have never told us about the Walker matter. Did you
know something about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I didn't know about that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You are going to let her finish this other, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't know about that until it came out in the paper. But
I have a story on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You want to finish this incident about the gun you are talking
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About Robert knowing about the gun&mdash;I have already said that.</p>

<p>About Lee being left handed, and he and Robert going squirrel hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said there was another gun matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a long, long story.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think she has gotten to the <span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I got to the point. I finished this story, really, don't you think&mdash;about
the gun?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think about Robert knowing Lee was left handed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Has anything happened since that, that you care to call to
our attention, things that you know about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the particular story that I have said this morning&mdash;you
mean of Lee?</p>

<p>This is where it gets confusing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Where did you go after the Parkland Hospital? What
happened then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes. This is interesting.</p>

<p>After the Parkland Hospital, then this Mike Howard said, "Well, what we
will do, we have a place, and this is where we will take them."</p>

<p>And they took us to the Inn of the Six Flags, which is on the outskirts of
Arlington, Tex. They took us there.</p>

<p>And I am assuming that it is a Secret Service hideout or something, because
they had made no arrangements or anything. We just were welcomed right
in the Inn. They knew where to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What happened there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, Mr. Rankin, that is so important&mdash;if we are going
to recess, I am going to ask not to start that story, because that is a very long,
important story to this Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How far is that from Dallas&mdash;the Six Flags Inn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, it is in between Dallas and Fort Worth, Tex. It is near
Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will recess now until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARGUERITE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will be in order. Mrs. Oswald, you may
continue with your statement.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the way leaving, I remarked to Mr. Doyle that I had forgotten
one very important factor in the story.</p>

<p>I had in Mrs. Paine's home, when Marina closed the door, and I was in the
room&mdash;before she showed me the picture&mdash;she told me at the police station
that they had showed her Lee's gun and asked her if that was Lee's gun,
and she said she didn't know, that Lee had a gun, but she could not say whether
that was Lee's gun or not. But that she knew that Lee had a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was in Mrs. Paine's home the night of November 22, when
we came from the jail. She told me that she told the police. I am going to
explain, because I don't want to be put in why I didn't say it.</p>

<p>Mr. Mark Lane had hoped to come before the Commission, and he wanted to
ask me two questions. He didn't say what the questions were. But I know
the affidavit presented to the Warren Commission passed on that. And so that
is why I had put that particular thing off my mind, thinking Mr. Lane would
bring it up. But I immediately told Mr. Doyle when I left, that Mr. Lane
not being here I should have made that statement.</p>

<p>Was there something else I told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. No. I think that was the matter you had mentioned to me, ma'am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean the gun or the picture of the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;the gun. The police showed Marina a gun&mdash;showed Marina
a gun, and asked Marina if that was Lee's gun, because Marina had
testified at the police station, she told me that Lee had a gun in Mrs. Paine's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
garage, and this was the gun that was presumably used to assassinate the
President, that the police had and showed it to Marina, and asked Marina
if that was Lee's gun that was in the garage. She said she didn't know&mdash;that
Lee had a gun in the garage, but she did not know whether that was the gun or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have any discussion with Marina about the gun after
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;when she said that, that was it. Any comments&mdash;as
I said before&mdash;that was it.</p>

<p>Now, where did I finish, please, so I can continue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, you had gotten to the Six Flags, and you had heard about
your son being killed. And then you had gotten to the Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were through at the Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You had gotten through with the Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And then we got to the chief of police's home in Irving. And
we finished that. So now we are at the Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. So the FBI agent took us to the Six Flags.</p>

<p>I was never questioned by the Secret Service or the FBI at Six Flags. My
son, in my presence, was questioned and taped, and Marina was continuously
questioned and taped. But I have never been questioned.</p>

<p>I had all the papers from the State Department, and all of my research from
Lee's I say so-called defection. And I wanted them to have them. All the
papers were at home.</p>

<p>I told them I thought I could save a lot of manpower, while they were
getting the original papers, because I know that each department in the State Department
had a reference on Lee, and I had the whole thing condensed, and
by them having my papers, they could get the picture. They were not interested
in any papers I had. They were not interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you not questioned on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. Here is what you may have on tape.</p>

<p>I insisted so much that they talked to me, because I had all this&mdash;that
Mr. Mike Howard finally agreed&mdash;not 22d, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is Mr. Harlan Brown and Mr. Charles T. Brown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is the two FBI agents, Mr. Brown, questioned me in the
office. But all they wanted to know is how did I know my son was an agent,
and how did I know that he had the money from the State Department. And
I told them Congressman Wright knew, and that they would investigate Congressman
Wright. That was a very short questioning. I mean I explained
that before. I told them I wanted to talk to the FBI, and I did. And it was
the two Mr. Browns, and there were two other men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then Mr. Howard was what date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mike Howard? Mike Howard was toward the end, because I
was so persistent in them talking to me, that finally he decided he would put
me on tape. But I do not consider this questioning. It was the date of the
funeral&mdash;I remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. November 25th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Was that the day of the funeral? If this was the day of the funeral&mdash;I
can tell you why. He decided he would put me on tape. So I
started to tell him about my having the papers, and Lee's defection. And then
Robert came out of the room and was crying bitterly. I saw Robert crying.</p>

<p>Wait, I am ahead of my story.</p>

<p>You have to understand this. As a family, we separated&mdash;not maybe for
any particular reason, it is just the way we live. I am not a mother that has a
home that the children can come to and feed them and so on. I am a working
mother. I do 24-hour duty. So I am not that type mother, where I am a
housewife with money, that the children have a home to come to.</p>

<p>So I said to Mike Howard, "I would like Robert to hear this. Maybe he
will learn something." Because Robert never did want to know about my
trip to Washington. He doesn't know. Robert never was interested in anything.
Lee did not want to know about my trip to Washington. So I thought
well now this is an opportunity, since the tragedy has happened, for Mr. Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Oswald to know some of these things that his mother has known all of these
years.</p>

<p>So I started.</p>

<p>Then Robert had a phone call and he came out of the room, and he was crying
bitterly. So I ended the tape&mdash;I would say I talked approximately 10 minutes.
I ended the tape saying, "I'm sorry, but my thoughts have left me, because my
son is crying."</p>

<p>I thought for a moment that Robert was crying because of what I was
saying, and he was sorry that he had not listened to me before, because I tried to
tell him about the defection and my trip to Washington. But Robert was crying
because he received a telephone call that we could not get a minister at my son's
grave.</p>

<p>They had three ministers that refused to come to the ceremony at my son's
grave&mdash;for church. And that is why Robert was crying bitterly. So that
ended the testimony. That little while I testified, that ended it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, that questioning was a question and answer. You were
questioned by the FBI agent, Mr. <span class="locked">Howard&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I was just talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Mike Howard. I was talking on tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Didn't he ask you questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't recall him asking any questions. It could be. But I
frankly do not recall him asking any questions. But it was a very short session.
And that is the way I ended the tape. I said, "My thoughts have left me because
I see my son crying bitterly."</p>

<p>That is the way I ended the tape. And it was a very short tape. I do not
remember him questioning me. I think I started to tell my story. And that is
the only time.</p>

<p>It was from my persistence that I got on tape just that little while. They
did not want to hear anything from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't think, then, that at that time there were questions
and answers for about 28 pages taken from you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From me&mdash;no, sir. Definitely not. If they have that, what they
have is my talking, like I said, when I saw on television. They said&mdash;they
were showing Lee's gun. And I was not watching television&mdash;I am getting
snatches of it, and I said, "Now, how can they say, even though it is Lee's
gun, that Lee shot the President. Even being his gun doesn't mean that he shot
the President. Someone could have framed him."</p>

<p>If they have 28 pages of that, they have me doing that kind of talking, and
had the room bugged, or whatever you want to say. But no, sir, I did not sit
and testify. I swear before God 10 times I never have. And that is the point
that has bothered me.</p>

<p>Even before Lee's defection no one came along to the house. I called
Mr. John Fain in the FBI myself to make friends with him. If they have 20
pages of testimony&mdash;that is when they got it, my talking. They got it with a
tape recorder going. But I did not, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, then, what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now&mdash;we got off of that. About Robert crying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said that that ended the interview with Mr. Howard.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that ended the interview with Mr. Howard, because
Robert was crying. I was not consulted. I want you to know this, too. I was not
consulted about the graveyard services or any part of my son's funeral.</p>

<p>What I know&mdash;when my son was going to be buried&mdash;it was approximately 1
hour before the time for my son to be buried. My son Robert knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether Marina was consulted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know. And I am assuming that she was. You see,
Mr. Gregory taught Russian to Marina. And I believe Marina might have been
consulted. But I do not know whether she was consulted or not. But I was not
consulted. And since then&mdash;we will go on to the story. They have put a marker
on the grave. I have not been consulted. I have found out my son is encased
in cement, and I did not know anything about it until I investigated and asked
the man at the cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
They did not consult me about anything, never have. I want that made clear&mdash;because
that is the part I cannot understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know whether the laws of Texas give the widow
the right to say what shall be done?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, naturally, she is his wife, and I am just the mother. But
from a moral standpoint, what are they doing to me? Law and right&mdash;but from
a moral standpoint, I should go out to the graveyard and see a marker? I should
find out from strangers that my son is now in a concrete vault?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, then, did you go to the funeral?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, let me get&mdash;we will get to the story of the ministers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I was not consulted. Had Robert asked me&mdash;they are
Lutheran, we are raised Lutherans. I have no church affiliation. I have learned
since my trouble that my heart is my church. I am not talking against the
church. But I go to church all day long, I meditate. And my work requires
that I don't go to church. I am working on Sunday most of the time, taking
care of the sick, and the people that go to church, that I work for, the families,
have never once said, "Well, I will stay home and take care of my mother and
let you go to church, Mrs. Oswald, today."</p>

<p>You see, I am expected to work on Sunday.</p>

<p>So that is why&mdash;I have my own church. And sometimes I think it is better
than a wooden structure. Because these same people that expect me to work on
Sunday, while they go to church, and go to church on Wednesday night&mdash;I don't
consider them as good a Christian as I am&mdash;I am sorry.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;I would not have let Robert be so upset trying to get a Lutheran
minister. If he could not get a Lutheran minister, I would have called upon
another minister, because there would have been many, many ministers of
many denominations that would have been happy to come and help the sorrowing
family.</p>

<p>Well, a Reverend French from Dallas came out to Six Flags and we sat on
the sofa.</p>

<p>Reverend French was in the center, I and Robert on the side. And Robert
was crying bitterly and talking to Reverend French and trying to get him to
let Lee's body go to church. And he was quoting why he could not.</p>

<p>So then I intervened and said, "Well, if Lee is a lost sheep, and that is why
you don't want him to go to church, he is the one that should go into church.
The good people do not need to go to church. Let's say he is called a murderer.
It is the murderers and all we should be concerned about".</p>

<p>And that agent&mdash;I am going ahead of my story a little bit&mdash;that man
right <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are pointing <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This agent right here. You may pass the picture around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The figure on the left hand of the picture you have just
produced?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I do not know his name. The man had the decency
to stay at the far end of the room, near the entrance door, while the minister
and myself and Robert were sitting on the sofa. And when I said to the
minister about the lost sheep, this agent, who I will have a much longer
story to talk about, left the group and came and sat on the other sofa&mdash;there
were two sofas and a cocktail table&mdash;and he said, "Mrs. Oswald, be
quiet. You are making matters worse."</p>

<p>Now, the nerve of him&mdash;to leave the group and to come there and scold me.</p>

<p>This Mr. French, Reverend French, agreed that we would have chapel
services, that he could not take the body into the church. And we compromised
for chapel services.</p>

<p>However, when we arrived at the graveyard, we went to the chapel.
There is the body being brought into the chapel. There is another picture.
Here is another picture of the chapel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before we go <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And the chapel was empty. My son's body had been
brought into the chapel, but Reverend French did not show up. And because
there was a time for the funeral, the Star Telegram reporters and the police,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
as you see in the picture, escorted my son's body from the chapel and put it
at the grave site. And when we went to the cemetery, we went directly to
the chapel, because we were promised to have chapel services. And the chapel
was empty. My son's body was not in it. Robert cried bitterly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, can I interrupt a minute?</p>

<p>We will have the reporter identify this photograph that you just referred
to, where the FBI agent is in the lefthand corner.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 165 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The photograph I have just referred to is Exhibit 165, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Exhibit 165.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the FBI agent you refer to is in the upper lefthand corner
of that exhibit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's right. And this is the other FBI agent, Mr. Mike
Howard, who is going to be involved quite a bit. He is the one that was
taking care of Baine Johnson. He is the one that they have now sent to
protect me in Fort Worth. He was the lead man at Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And he stands right behind you there in that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is Mr. Mike Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Isn't he a Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Secret Service man&mdash;they are both Secret Service.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> That was the point I wanted to make, because she had
said he was an FBI agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;please interrupt. It is awful hard for me to remember
and say things. So I appreciate you doing that. It is a long story. And
I have many stories, gentlemen. I have many stories that I am sure you do
not have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I'll ask the reporter to mark the other picture
with the chapel and the casket as Exhibit 166.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 166 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us if Exhibit 166 is a photograph showing the
removing of the casket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The way the men are coming this way, they are leaving
the chapel. That is the way I would assume. They are leaving the chapel.
But the body was not at the chapel. What an awful thing we went through,
gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibits 165 and 166, and ask to substitute
copies.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 165 and 166
were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, I will ask you to mark the picture of the chapel
with the casket apparently going in as Exhibit 167.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 167 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the picture of the chapel and the casket being placed on
a carrier in front of it, as Exhibit 168.</p>

<p>(The photograph referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 168 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you recall that Exhibit 167 is the picture of
them taking the casket into the chapel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And Exhibit 168 is apparently a picture in front of the chapel
where they are putting the casket on a carrier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibits 167 and 168 and ask leave to
substitute copies.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photographs previously marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 167 and 168
for identification were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, I don't remember if I stated while at Six Flags that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
this particular agent identified as being to the left of the picture, while the television
was on continuously&mdash;I have stated before I never did sit down and
watch it, because we were quite busy. And this was published in the Star
Telegram by Mr. Blair Justice, and also on the radio.</p>

<p>He was very, very rude to me. Anything that I said, he snapped. And I
took it for quite a while. At this particular time that they showed the gun
on television, I said, "How can they say Lee shot the President? Even
though they would prove it is his gun doesn't mean he used it&mdash;nobody saw
him use it."</p>

<p>He snapped back and he said, "Mrs. Oswald, we know that he shot the
President."</p>

<p>I then walked over to Mr. Mike Howard and I said, "What's wrong with that
agent? That agent is about to crack. All he has done is taunt me ever since
I have been here."</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Oswald, he was personal body guard to Mrs. Kennedy for 30
months and maybe he has a little opinion against you."</p>

<p>I said, "Let him keep his personal opinions to himself. He is on a job."</p>

<p>Now, there was another instance with this same agent. He followed Marina
around continuously. I'm going to make this plain. He followed Marina around
continuously. The pictures will always show him by Marina.</p>

<p>We were in the bedroom, and he was in the bedroom. And we were getting
ready for the funeral.</p>

<p>Marina was very unhappy with the dress&mdash;they bought her two dresses.
"Mama, too long." "Mama, no fit." And it looked lovely on her. You can see
I know how to dress properly. I am in the business world as merchandise
manager. And the dress looked lovely on Marina. But she was not happy
with it.</p>

<p>I said, "Oh, honey, put your coat on, we are going to Lee's funeral. It will
be all right."</p>

<p>And we had 1 hour in order to get ready for the funeral.</p>

<p>I said, "We will never make it. Marina is so slow."</p>

<p>She said, "I no slow. I have things to do."</p>

<p>I am trying to impress upon you that Marina understands English, and has
always talked broken English.</p>

<p>Now, this agent was in the room and Robert was on the telephone. That is
why he was allowed in the bedroom.</p>

<p>While Marina was complaining about her dress, my little grandbaby, 2 years
old&mdash;and she is a very precious little baby, they are good children&mdash;was standing
by her mother. And Marina was very nervous by this time. She was not
happy with the dress. And Marina was combing her hair. She took the comb
and she hit June on the head. I said, "Marina, don't do that." And this agent&mdash;I
wish I knew his name&mdash;snapped at me and said, "Mrs. Oswald, you let her
alone." I said, "Don't tell me what to say to my daughter-in-law when she was
hitting my grandbaby on the head with a comb" in front of Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Now, why did this man do these things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you saying that the agent did anything improper, as far as
Marina was concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, what do you mean when you say improper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any improper relationship between them, as far as
you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I am saying&mdash;and I am going to say it as strongly as I
can&mdash;that I&mdash;and I have stated this from the beginning&mdash;that I think our
trouble in this is in our own Government. And I suspect these two agents of
conspiracy with my daughter-in-law in this plot.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. With who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With Marina and Mrs. Paine&mdash;the two women. Lee was set
up, and it is quite possible these two Secret Service men are involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Which ones are you referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Mike Howard and the man that I did not&mdash;did not know
the name, the man in the picture to the left. I have reason to think so because
I was at Six Flags and these are just some instances that happened&mdash;I have
much more stories to tell you of my conclusions. I am not a detective, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
don't say it is the answer to it. But I must tell you what I think, because I am
the only one that has this information.</p>

<p>Now, here is another <span class="locked">instance&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What kind of a conspiracy are you describing that these men
are engaged in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that two Secret Service agents and Marina and Mrs.
Paine were involved in that, in the conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I do. Besides another high official. I will tell you the
high official I have in mind when we go through that part of the story, if you
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, now, could you tell us what you base that on&mdash;because
that is a very serious charge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is a very serious charge, and I realize that. I base that on
what I told you, the attitude of this man, and Mike Howard's attitude also.</p>

<p>Now, I have to continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you described that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I have to continue.</p>

<p>While at Six Flags, Marina was given the red carpet treatment. Marina
was Marina. And it was not that Marina is pretty and a young girl. Marina
was under&mdash;what is the word&mdash;I won't say influence&mdash;these two men were to
see that Marina was Marina. I don't know how to say it. Are you getting the
point? Let me see if I can say it better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean they were taking care of her, or were they doing more
than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. More than taking care of Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, now, describe what more.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, I will describe it for you.</p>

<p>I am not quite satisfied with the way I said that. Let me get my thoughts
together.</p>

<p>I noticed that&mdash;and of course as I have testified, the way the man treated
me&mdash;and I was told he was a body guard for Mrs. Kennedy. We were at Six
Flags on November 24th, at Lee's death, and on November 26th Marina and I&mdash;before
November 26th&mdash;Marina and I were very, very friendly, very loving,
everything was "Mama"&mdash;"Mama has a big heart." And we planned to live
together.</p>

<p>I had an insurance policy that had expired on Lee. I was not able to keep
up the premium. And I had $863. But however I had not looked at the policy
for some years, and I was not quite sure that it was in force. But otherwise
I had no money and no job. I had given up my job to come to the rescue. So
I was very anxious to get home and get my papers and let them see the copies
of everything I had, and to find out if I had my insurance policy, if it was in
force, and also get some clothes.</p>

<p>From the 24th until the 26th I lived in my uniform, gentlemen. I did not
have any clothes at the Six Flags. Yet Robert Oswald was taken to his home
a couple of times to get clothes. And when I wanted to go home and get
clothes, they put me off. One time I broke down crying. I said, "I don't understand
it. You won't do anything for me, yet you drove Robert all the way
to Denton to get clothes."</p>

<p>So the night of the 26th they took me home, and I got my papers. I found
that my insurance policy was in force. So I said to Marina, "Marina, we all
right. Mama has insurance policy, $800. You stay home with baby and mama
work, or mama stay home with baby and you work, and at least we have a
start."</p>

<p>"Okay, Mama. I not want big house, Mama. I want small place."</p>

<p>And this is the girl that has never had anything, and she only wanted small
things. Fine.</p>

<p>On the date of the 22d, approximately 10 o'clock&mdash;this was in the morning&mdash;I
want to say something to Marina, and Marina shrugged me off and walked
away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What date was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The 27th. That morning I had acted as interpreter for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
FBI agent, and Mr. Mike Howard said, "Would you like us to get a Russian
interpreter?" And he said, "No, Mrs. Oswald is doing fine." And he took the
testimony from me as an interpreter. So, you see my daughter-in-law did understand
English and answered me in her Russian broken English, because the
FBI man was satisfied.</p>

<p>So when Marina shrugged me off, I thought right away that she thought&mdash;because
I had to use the name Lee so many times&mdash;that I was hurting her
husband, and maybe that is why she felt this way. So I thought maybe I am
just imagining things. So I waited quite a while, I would say half an hour.
I went to Marina again. And she walked away and shrugged me off.</p>

<p>So I walked into the living room, where my son, Robert Oswald, and the
Secret Service were and I said to Robert, "Robert, something is wrong with
Marina. She won't have anything to do with me."</p>

<p>He said, "I know why. Marina has been offered a home by a very wealthy
woman"&mdash;all of this was done without my knowledge&mdash;"by a very wealthy
woman who will give her children education, and she didn't know how to tell
you."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, Robert, why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>Of course when I said it. I was emotionally upset. I said, "Robert, why
didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>He said, "Because just the way you are acting now."</p>

<p>I said, "What do you mean the way I am acting now? I am acting in a
normal fashion. You are telling me that you are taking my daughter-in-law
and my grandchildren away from me, and I have lost my son, and my grandchildren
and daughter are going to live with strangers. This is a normal
reaction."</p>

<p>"Well, that is why we didn't tell you. We knew you would take it that way."</p>

<p>And that is the last time I have talked to my daughter-in-law, Marina. And
that is the rift between Marina and I. There is no rift, sir? We were going
to live together. But this home was offered Marina&mdash;and I will present this
in evidence.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Gregory is involved&mdash;Mr. Gregory did all the Russian talking.
They all knew better but me. And I have more to the story.</p>

<p>Yes, here it is.</p>

<p>And there are other offers Marina had&mdash;other offers.</p>

<p>So I was not able to be around Marina. The Secret Service saw to it.
And they gloated.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I am not imagining these things. These two men gloated of the
fact that now Marina is going to be fixed&mdash;you know, she is fixed financially
and otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is this Mrs. Pultz?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I didn't even read this, sir, believe me. This was handed to
me by a reporter before I left, saying, "Mrs. Oswald, maybe these things"&mdash;because
he knows the story. This has all been published publicly in newspapers,
what I am saying. The Star Telegram could give you all I am
saying here. It has already been made public in the paper, all of this.
And he handed that to me. I never did see that article until the other
day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This article refers to Mrs. Oswald being offered a home, and
apparently a newspaper account&mdash;a newspaper account of the offer, according
to this newspaper account&mdash;the offer was by a Mrs. Pultz. That
is the one that you refer to when you handed this paper to us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is offering her a home.</p>

<p>Now, I have not read that. I know she was offered a home by a woman and
I will tell you further what I do know about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, I will ask you to identify this as the next
exhibit.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 169 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, the reporter has marked that Exhibit 169, the
newspaper article you have just given us, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I now offer in evidence Exhibit 169 and ask please to substitute
a copy.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 169 for identification
was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I left there on the 28th, so it would have to be the 27th.
It would have to be the 27th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, there were other people that offered her homes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you seemed to think there was something improper or
bad about your son Robert wanting to get your daughter Marina taken care
of in this manner. I don't understand that. Can you explain it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Well&mdash;no&mdash;as I have explained before, Robert and I
are not close, we are not close as a family. But Robert is a very easy-going
person. He is not opinionated, particularly like I am. My older son and
Lee are my disposition. But because you are a Secret Service man or somebody,
if you tell him something, he will go along and yes you. So he was
part of this arrangement. They probably had to have his consent. But
he knew of the arrangement with Mr. Gregory and Marina. They all knew it
but me. I was not consulted about this at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you think Robert was trying to do something bad by it,
or just trying to look out <span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He thought it was a good idea, that Marina should go and live
in this home. But I took a different attitude. I am not interested in
material things, gentlemen. I then went into my speech, that I thought, as
a family, Marina and I should stick together and face our future together. I
could see no reason&mdash;and I made this at the Six Flags, and have made it
public in the newspapers, I could see no reason, no advantage of Marina
living with strangers. I said that before. I thought it would be better,
original idea, Marina and I had made, to live in my apartment and do the
best we can. And I even said&mdash;we have $863 to start with, and then if we
don't make it "What about you helping us?"</p>

<p>"But give us a chance as a family. Don't put the girl in a strange home,
a Russian girl, a foreign girl, taken away from her Mama."</p>

<p>Marina has no mother and father&mdash;she has a stepfather. But I was her
Mama up until this time. And I could not see Marina in a strange home.</p>

<p>Well, I am going to prove this story to you. It is a fantastic story. But
as I go along&mdash;I have witnesses&mdash;and that is why I asked you, sir, I would
like these people called to back up these fantastic stories I am telling you.
It can be proven, sir.</p>

<p>So I had no further contact with my daughter-in-law&mdash;once they came out
and said what they had planned. I had no inkling of it. That was the&mdash;they
wanted to keep her and the children away from me.</p>

<p>That night, the night of November 27th&mdash;now, we were in a bedroom with
twin beds that we shared. They opened the studio couch in the living
room, and rolled June's bed, the baby bed in the living room, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by "they"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The Secret Service had the maid come in with sheets and
everything and they got&mdash;opened the sofa into a bed. The Secret Service
rolled the baby bed from the bedroom into the living room. And I knew that
I was not wanted or involved. And I have a very dignified way about me.
I didn't say a word. What I did&mdash;I sat up in a chair all night long in the
living room, rather than to be so indignant as to sleep in the bedroom
where they had taken my daughter-in-law from me. I sat up in a chair
in the living room rather than be pushed aside like I was being pushed
aside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, now, what Secret Servicemen were these&mdash;Mr. Howard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Howard was involved, and this other man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The same man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This same man. And my son is in this, too. Robert was part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of this conspiracy that they were going to let her go to a home, and they didn't
tell me&mdash;and Mr. Peter Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did they move your daughter-in-law out into the living
room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she slept on the sofa. And they moved June's baby
bed from the bedroom into the living room, by my daughter-in-law. And I sat
in a chair. I can do that. I am a nurse, and I can do without sleep. And I had
all the papers. I told you that the night before they took me home to get my
papers. And that is why I knew I had the insurance money. So I started to
work on the papers. And I sat up all night long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did Marina say about that arrangement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was nothing said between Marina and I. The last time
I had seen Marina was when she shrugged me off, and then this came out why
she shrugged me off. I have had no contact with Marina since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, why do you think there is a conspiracy about this? Can
you explain that to us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About this particular instance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I don't say that is a particular instance. But it is
certainly a very unusual way to do a thing, a very unusual way&mdash;not to consult
me. Marina and I were friends. She was going to come and live with me. I
was going to share my money with her. And then they went ahead and planned
all this without my knowledge.</p>

<p>Maybe you know the answer to it, I don't know. But there was no hard
feelings&mdash;even now I love Marina and I would take and help her any way I
can.</p>

<p>So I don't understand these things. But I am telling you the way things
happen, the way I was excluded. And your Secret Service agents had part of
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you do not think Robert and the Secret Service agents
could be acting in good faith to try to just help Marina and her children along?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I cannot see from my point of view that it would be good
that a foreign girl lives in a stranger's home, a perfect stranger who has come
to the police department and offered her a home. We are talking about a
perfect stranger. If she is a perfect stranger&mdash;maybe she wasn't. I have no
way of knowing. But I am going to assume what I read. It would be much
better for this girl to go live in this stranger's home than to be with her family?
This girl and my grandchildren needed a family, which I was that family. I
cannot see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What I am asking you is: Do you think it is possible that Robert
was just mistaken when he and the Secret Service man, if they are involved,
thought this might be a good plan. Isn't it possible they were trying to do the
right thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I think it was deliberate. I am sure&mdash;I don't think.
I am positive it was deliberate. And I will tell you why as we go along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you said you thought it was deliberate.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am trying to get everything in, so you can get a clear picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, this plan to have your daughter-in-law go and live with
another lady&mdash;this Mrs. Pultz&mdash;you said you did not think it could be innocent
or in good faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;because then this same Secret Service man, that I don't
know the name&mdash;now, I may be wrong about this&mdash;just a moment. No&mdash;this
is not the same man.</p>

<p>One of the other Secret Service men had gone to talk to Robert's boss, because
Robert was worried about his job. So this happened in the afternoon. I had
no contact with Marina. And he came in and in front of me he patted Robert
on the shoulder and said, "Now, Robert, I have talked to your boss and you are
all right. I assured him you are not involved in any way."</p>

<p>So, gentlemen, Marina is taken care of; Robert is taken care of&mdash;I am not
feeling sorry for myself, believe me, because I can take care of myself. But
here is a mother who has come to the rescue, lost her job, offered her good love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
and insurance money, and nobody has wondered what is going to become of
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, did you think it was improper that the Secret Service man
would go to Robert's boss and tell him he was not involved, that there was
nothing improper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not. I think it was a fine gesture. And that is
the point I am trying to make out. Why are these fine gestures to see that
Marina is going to have a home and be taken care of, and Robert's job is
secure&mdash;but I am nothing. I was not included in the plans. And what is going
to become of me? I have no income. I have no job. I lost my job. And
nobody thought about me.</p>

<p>I don't mean to imply I'm sorry for myself. I am trying to bring out a point
that through all of this, that I have not been considered, even as much as to
testify. I want to know why. I don't understand why.</p>

<p>It is very strange.</p>

<p>I packed during the night, sat up in the chair, as I said.</p>

<p>So the next morning I am on my way home. I have no purpose to be there.
I was helping my daughter-in-law, and helping the children. But now I am out
of everything, so I insist on going home.</p>

<p>Before going home, I asked to tell Marina goodby, and my grandchildren, and
what they have done this morning&mdash;they have taken her out of these quarters
and brought her next door, to the other quarters of the Inn&mdash;it is just one door
and a little courtyard to the other door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What day is this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the 28th. So the agent that was taking me home&mdash;I'm
sorry, but I'm very bad at names, and there were so many agents, it is awfully
hard for me to remember it all. I told him that I wanted to tell Marina that I
was going. He knocked on the door. The Russian interpreter from the State
Department, Mr. Gopadze, came to the door, and the agent said, "Mrs. Oswald
is going home and wants to tell Marina and the children goodby."</p>

<p>He said, "Well, we are interviewing her, and she is on tape. She will get in
touch with you."</p>

<p>So I never saw Marina after that time.</p>

<p>Now, what worried me so was what did Marina think. What did Marina
know of this, and what did she think? Did she think I deserted her? Did they
think I left without telling her goodby? This worried me very much. I could
picture the girl. What did she think? I didn't even get to tell her goodby.</p>

<p>So I tried in vain to see Marina. I have called Mr. F.&nbsp;V. Sorrels over and
over and over, and he has never told me that Marina did not want to see me.
And this, gentlemen, I have proof of. He always said, "Well, Mrs. Oswald, I
am not able to divulge where she is" and the regular push-around. He is not
telling me plainly I am not going to see Marina, he is being very courteous to me,
but not letting me see Marina&mdash;if I am making this plain. And I have publicly
blasted that. Over and over I have tried unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Mark Lane, who is representing my son, talked with Mr. Jim Martin and
Mr. Thorne&mdash;Jim Martin is Marina's business manager, and Mr. Thorne is her
attorney. And Mr. Jim Martin and Thorne have stated to Mr. Mark Lane that
Marina did not want to talk to me.</p>

<p>Now, this is approximately a month ago, I would say, when I first engaged
Mr. Mark Lane. And Mr. Mark Lane said to me that he was not satisfied, when
he gave me the information. I said, "No, I want Marina to tell me that." How
did I know it was Marina's quote?</p>

<p>Mr. Sorrels never told me that Marina did not want to talk to me. But this
was told to Mr. Mark Lane. But I would not take that as a quote. I wanted to
hear it from Marina.</p>

<p>So we persistently tried to see Marina. When I say we, almost every reporter
in the city of Fort Worth and Dallas has tried to see Marina. Mr. Mark Lane
has tried to see Marina. Mr. Olds, who is head of the Civil Liberties Association&mdash;I
don't know if that's the proper name&mdash;in Fort Worth has tried to see
Marina. And there have been many prominent people trying to see Marina, because
they could not understand how Marina could be under such strict surveillance
that no one could be allowed to see Marina. There have been many, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
people question this. It has been questioned, why Marina would be under
strict seclusion for 6 weeks, with not a soul seeing Marina. I say not a soul.
My son saw Marina at Christmas time, and probably had seen her before then.</p>

<p>His family went with him&mdash;I checked with my daughter-in-law, Vada, and
she said she went with Robert for Christmas time. It came over the news
in Fort Worth that Marina's brother-in-law, Lee's brother, would be with her
at Christmas time, and Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was unavailable for news.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I stayed home crying, hoping against hope that the Secret Service
would come and let me be with my family for Christmas time, waiting there
patiently. I was available for news. I had blasted this in the paper over and
over. I waited for them to come get me. But there again, I am excluded.</p>

<p>Do you know the answers to all these exclusions? I do not.</p>

<p>The first time Marina ever made any statement or public appearance was
approximately 2 weeks ago, or maybe not that long. She was on an exclusive
television program. Channel 4 in Fort Worth, Tex., when she stated publicly
that in her mind she thought that Lee shot President Kennedy. What an awful
thing for this 22-year-old foreign girl to think. She thinks in her mind. She
doesn't know. But she thinks, gentlemen. That tape can be sent back to you.
That was her quote. I watched every television program, and I took it down in
black and white. "In my mind, I think Lee shot President Kennedy."</p>

<p>She doesn't know our American way of life. Lee Harvey Oswald will be
the accused assassin of President Kennedy when this information is over with,
believe me.</p>

<p>She is a Russian girl, and maybe they do this in Russia. But what I am
going to say is that Marina Oswald was brainwashed by the Secret Service,
who have kept her in seclusion for 8 weeks&mdash;8 weeks, gentlemen, with no one
talking to Marina.</p>

<p>Marina does not read English. Marina knows none of the facts from newspaper
account. The only way Marina can get facts is through what the FBI
and the Secret Service probably are telling her, or some of the facts that Marina
has manufactured since.</p>

<p>I am sorry, gentlemen, but this is a true story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you base your claim on, that Marina was brainwashed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because for 8 weeks no one has been allowed to see Marina. I
do not believe in my mind that that is an American way of life. I question the
fact that it is even legal, that they can keep her in strict seclusion with no one
seeing her for 8 weeks, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Now, there may be a reason for that. I don't know. But the American
people want some answer to that. I have over 1,500 letters questioning that.
The papers have blasted it continuously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If she didn't have somebody to look out for her, do you think
the various people that wanted to see her would keep her so busy she could not
even take care of the children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, Mr. Rankin, I am not saying, even implying that the
Secret Service should not protect my daughter-in-law. I am grateful for
that, and I have expressed it. I am most grateful she has protection. But
would there have been any harm for me to talk to Marina with the Secret
Service around and let Marina tell me that she does not want to see me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, let's leave you out of it. What about all the rest of the
people that would want&mdash;or did want to see Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And take her time, while she had to take care of the children.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I agree with that. Marina should not see every Tom, Dick,
and Harry. I think they are doing a wonderful job in protecting her. But
when Mr. Mark Lane, who is an attorney, requested it, so we can solve this,
to just let Marina tell him that she doesn't want to see her mama, and Mr.
Olds, who is head of Civil Liberties, was refused permission to see her, then
we question it.</p>

<p>No, I don't think all the people should see Marina. But people are asking
these questions, Mr. Rankin. They want to know why a high official cannot
see Marina, to satisfy the public's demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, Marina had her own counsel at that time, she said. Mr.
Thorne was her attorney.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Now, we will get to Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>When I first contacted Mr. Thorne I said, "Mr. Thorne, how is my daughter-in-law
and grandchildren?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Thorne really apologized to me. He said, "Mrs. Oswald, they are
fine. But I am unable to divulge their whereabouts."</p>

<p>He volunteered the information to me.</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, sir; I am not asking where they are"&mdash;because I had
already&mdash;by the time she got this attorney&mdash;by the time I had contacted him,
we had been fighting this thing to see Marina. But he volunteered the information.
He said, "Your daughter-in-law and grandchildren are fine, but I am
not able to divulge their whereabouts."</p>

<p>I said, "I am not asking about their whereabouts." I said that I had Lee's
Marine book, which is a big, colorful book, the life of a Marine, that Lee had
sent to me, and Lee's baby book; that I had had in my possession ever since he
was a baby, that I gave to Marina and Lee when they returned to Russia, and
my husband's gold pocket watch I had all those years I gave to Lee. So I asked
Mr. Thorne about these things and he said he would inquire about it.</p>

<p>I said, "Mr. Thorne, while I am on the 'phone I do want to bring something
up. While I was at Six Flags, the day I left, the morning I left, is the first
time that sympathy cards started coming in, and money. And these envelopes
were addressed to Mrs. Marina Oswald and Marguerite Oswald, or Mrs. Marguerite
Oswald and Marina, to both."</p>

<p>The Secret Service started to open the envelopes, and there were checks and
cash. Because of my prior story that they had pushed me aside, I said, "Now,
my moneys that come in that says 'and mother' I definitely want my share."</p>

<p>Believe me, gentlemen, I have never received 1 penny.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They said yes&mdash;and my son was there when I said that&mdash;they
said they would divide it. If it was a $10 bill and it said the mother of Lee
and the wife, that I would get 5 and Marina would get 5. So when I talked to
Mr. Thorne I said, "I want to tell you, Mr. Thorne, while I was at Six Flags,
I know of moneys coming in, but I have never received a penny. But I want
you to know that the Secret Service in my home, because they were in my home
from the 28th until the 3d"&mdash;I believe it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Third of what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be December. Because this was the 28th of
November&mdash;approximately the 3d. The money that came into my home that
way, 'Mrs. Marguerite Oswald and Marina Oswald' the Secret Service divided
right then and there. If it was a $10 bill, I got 5 and they took 5 to give to
Marina. Whether Marina ever got the money or not, I have no way of knowing.
But the money in my home was divided and the share given to Marina. But I
never did get the share from the Secret Service at this time.</p>

<p>So 2 weeks <span class="locked">later&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How much did that amount to, that was divided in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Very little. My contributions up to now are just a little over
$900&mdash;about $905. That is the money that has been given direct to me, the
mother of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>So about 3 weeks later&mdash;now, Mr. Lane comes in here. He has all of these
documents and all of these dates and everything. I don't know about the
dates.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorne&mdash;from Mr. Thome's office and Mr. Martin I receive an envelope
about this size with mail for me, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald&mdash;not "and Marina"&mdash;everyone
open, gentlemen&mdash;opened, no cash, but checks, made out to Mrs. Marguerite
Oswald, that nobody else of course could have any benefit from. This
late date. And there were checks way in November, in the beginning of December,
that were held all this time. But until I complained, then they decided
to send them to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane has in his possession photostatic copies of my mail that has been
opened by the Fort Worth Police. I had a tip from a reporter that my mail
at the mayor's office and the Fort Worth Police and the chief of police was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
photostatic copied. So I sent a telegram&mdash;and I have these things&mdash;you will
have everything I have&mdash;to each one, the same telegram, saying that any mail
addressed to Mrs. Marguerite Oswald should be forwarded to her immediately&mdash;to
me immediately at 2220 Thomas Place. I received no mail.</p>

<p>Three days later&mdash;I received no mail.</p>

<p>So I called Mr. Sorrels and told Mr. Sorrels about the tip that I had. And
I knew it was a positive tip&mdash;I could feel sure this young man was giving me
the right information. I had much information that the public knows, that
they have helped me in this case, Mr. Rankin. So Mr. Sorrels sent Mr. Seals,
I think his name was, a Secret Service man down and the chief of police gave
Mr. Seals&mdash;we have this&mdash;my mail opened and photostatic copies. I can produce
this evidence.</p>

<p>Now, what right&mdash;I am not an attorney&mdash;but we have a moral issue all through
this that I am fighting for.</p>

<p>If the mail went to the chief of police, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, in care of
the chief of police&mdash;it well could be that they have the legal right to open such
mail. But they do not have the moral right, because I was an international
figure, and everybody knew my address. And the chief of police and everybody
else knew my address. And that mail should have remained unopened. How
much cash was taken out of those mails? I do not know. And I am not really
saying there was. But there is quite a possibility that it was.</p>

<p>Then I received another package from Mr. Thorne, and my mail was opened.
I called Mr. Sorrels about that. He said he knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>First I called Mr. Thorne and he said that is the way he got the mail. So
then I called Mr. Sorrells and he said he knew nothing about it. I said, "Mr.
Sorrels, I'm getting awfully tired of this. Mr. Thorne doesn't know how my
mail is being opened. He says that he got the mail from the Secret Service.
And now you are telling me that you do not give the mail to Mr. Thorne. Where
does my mail come from opened?" So nobody knows anything, the things
that have happened to me.</p>

<p>My rights have been invaded continuously&mdash;continuously. Every newspaper
clipping was taken out of my home. Three letters from Lee, from Russia. I
offered all my information, as I explained over and over, to the Secret Service.
And while in my home, I was showing them things&mdash;because I was proud of
the things I have, and I think, gentlemen, when you see everything I have you
will see a different picture of this boy.</p>

<p>There were three letters taken from my letters from Lee. And how I came
to know that&mdash;a New York reporter had offered&mdash;he was going to write a story and
had offered to buy three of my letters. I told him he could have his choice. And
so he looked through the letters, and I looked through them with him, and
I missed these three letters. These three letters would have been of importance
to the Secret Service and to our government.</p>

<p>But you must remember, I have offered over and over to give any information
I have.</p>

<p>One letter stated that Marina's uncle was a colonel in the Russian Army&mdash;I
may produce this now. Is that what we need to do next&mdash;the letters?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was a colonel in what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. One letter said he was a colonel in what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That Marina's uncle was a colonel in the Russian Army.</p>

<p>Would you like to look at these letters while I continue, Mr. Doyle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are these the lost letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, these are letters from Lee to me from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I thought you said three were lost.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, three were lost. The one about the Russian colonel was
lost&mdash;that the Secret Service men took&mdash;three letters&mdash;that would be of importance
for them. But I offered to give it to them. But they were taken from
my home.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How did you get them back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am going to tell the story, and I have witnesses.</p>

<p>So when I missed them, Mr. Jack Langueth, who we can call as a witness,
who is a reporter for the New York Times, wanted to pay me for letters&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
printed the story in the paper with the three letters that he bought from me, three
different letters I am talking about now, and printed how many letters I had,
including the three letters that the FBI man that Marina's uncle was a colonel.
He printed the things in the paper.</p>

<p>So approximately 5 or 6 days later the Secret Service man&mdash;and I can find
his picture probably&mdash;came to my home and returned the three letters and got
a receipt from me for the three letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How much did this reporter offer to pay you for the letters and
other things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I got $50 for each letter. And I have the receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I don't understand yet. You offered to sell the letters to him,
or let him have use of them for $50 apiece?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. $150.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then he published them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Yes&mdash;he published the letters. It was published in the
New York Times, the three letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then they were returned to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, he never did take the letters. Mr. Langueth never did
take the letters he bought from me out of my hand. As I told you gentlemen,
we went to a photostatic place and the letters were copied, and I kept the
originals. He paid me $50. That was printed in the story. But the three
letters that the Secret Service men had, he printed in the story about Marina's
uncle being a colonel in the Russian Army. And that is the letter that the
Secret Service man had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you did not get paid for those at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;these are different letters. So they returned those letters
to me, the Secret Service, and I gave them a receipt for them. But they did
not ask my permission to take them, or let me have a receipt when they took
them. So I am trying to point out the fact that I got the three letters back,
I would think, because the story in the paper said that the Secret Service had
these three letters and parts of what they contained. So the three letters
were returned to me, and I had to sign a receipt for those three letters.</p>

<p>Am I making that clear now?</p>

<p>May I have some water, please?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Are we going to get these letters in the record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Let me get the letters in the record, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Let me go off the record a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not able to go into the defection now, because I am not
through with this part. The defection starts an entirely different story, if
you want to know the true facts, and it will take quite a while.</p>

<p>What sticks in my mind is this one particular letter about Marina's uncle.
The other two I am not quite sure.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What does it say about her uncle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I have to find the letter, sir.</p>

<p>I want to say this, gentleman. And maybe you are not in agreement with
me. But all my life I have known and I have thought that a title does not
make a man. It may be presumptuous of me that I am accusing the Secret
Service&mdash;because they are the Secret Service. But there are men in our
Government, and the Secret Service, who are undesirable, just like in any
other organization&mdash;let's face it. We have such men as Bobby Baker, who
was a citizen well thought of. Charles Van Doren who was well thought of.
Mr. Fred Korth who was under investigation, he was a wonderful citizen.
I can go on and on. Yet these men turned out not to be the right type.</p>

<p>I say this because my son was a self-styled Marxist, and a known defector,
and that is why his guilt was proven by the Dallas Police. And my son&mdash;had
he been a Senator or someone in the higher field, maybe they would not have
picked him up so fast. Now, that is a fact of our way of life, of human nature.
Having a title doesn't mean that you are the man back of the title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could we take those letters now and have the reporter identify
them? Here is the one about the uncle in the Army?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is one I am sure of.</p>

<p>Now, I did not finish the story of the woman offering Marina a home. I
have not finished that story, really. This affidavit that I showed you about
the woman offering Marina the home the morning of the 28th&mdash;I picked up the
newspaper and I read in the newspaper&mdash;I will be through with this story in
1 minute. I picked up the newspaper on the 28th of November and I read in the
newspaper where this woman had offered Marina a home. So I said to the agent
that was sitting up&mdash;everybody was sleeping, and as I told you I sat up all
<span class="locked">night&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This was 1963, after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1963. November 28. It was on the 27th that I knew my
daughter was offered a home. Nothing was said where. In fact, at the time
I thought she was going to live in Mr. Gregory's home. I just thought that.
I did not ask. I was so hurt, I did not ask.</p>

<p>But on the morning of the 28th I picked up the paper and read this story
about the woman going to the Dallas Police offering Marina a home. So I
said to this agent, "Evidently that is who Marina is going to live with." But
I did not know. But on the 28th is when I saw the story of the woman offering
Marina the home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you have produced a number of letters that you described
as being letters received from your son, Lee Oswald, while he was in the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And we have asked you if you could identify the three letters
that the Secret Service brought back to you and asked you to give a receipt
for. You said it is very difficult, if not impossible, for you to do that. Is
that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not say that. I said that one letter I was sure
of, because it stated that her uncle was an officer in the Soviet Union. That
letter I am sure of. The other two letters&mdash;I would have to go through the letters.
I think I could spot them, because it would be of importance to our country
and the Secret Service to know&mdash;in other words, it was important for them to
know she had an uncle in the Soviet Union. And the other two letters would be
on that order. And I believe maybe I could&mdash;I would not want to state a
fact that these two letters&mdash;I think I would be pretty close to choosing the
other two letters as the proper letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I wonder if it would be agreeable to you if we
would identify all of those letters that you received from your son while he was
in the Soviet Union, and then possibly when we recess you could look them
over and <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that's perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. See if you can pick out the ones you gave a receipt for.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is perfectly all right. Any way you want to do it is all
right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, I will ask you to mark them, and Mr. Liebeler,
will you help in the marking, because the letters are covered with glassine, and
it may be hard to mark them with ink. I think by putting those stickers on we
can help you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not all of the letters have dates. I think by taking the date
on the back of the envelope it would be all right. And we had them in order.
I don't know if they are still in order. But we had them by the dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, I offer in evidence Exhibits 170 to 179, both
inclusive, being pictures of the funeral and the casket that Mrs. Oswald has
produced here for the Commission, and ask leave to substitute copies.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be so introduced.</p>

<p>(The photographs referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 170 to
179 inclusive for identification, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I then offer the various letters that Mrs. Oswald produced, that
she said were sent to her by her son, Lee Harvey Oswald, from the Soviet Union.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
And I think it would be better for our record if I briefly state the date that the
envelopes bear in each case, so it can be compared with the number.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 180 bears the date of July 18, 1961, on the envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Rankin&mdash;is that the American or the Russian postmark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the American postmark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Time of receipt in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Oswald, I understand from you there was one letter before the
letter bearing the date July 18, 1961, on the American postmark on the envelope,
and you do not have that here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I may have it. I have many more papers and documents. I
have a suitcase almost full that I have not yet opened. The suitcase was lost.
We did not receive it until about 9 o'clock last night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have not produced it today, though.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. But there is one more letter. It is the very first letter I
received from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I call the attention of the Commission to the statement in Exhibit
180, "She was living at her aunt's place when I met her. They are real
nice people. Her uncle is a major in the Soviet Army."</p>

<p>Exhibit 181, dated August 3, 1961, was the envelope postmarked United States,
August 10, 1961. I also offer that.</p>

<p>Exhibit 182, dated October 2, 1961, with the American postmark October 10,
1961. I also offer that.</p>

<p>In each case, Mr. Chairman, I ask leave to substitute copies in accordance
with our understanding.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. We will make a blanket ruling on all of them when
you finish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Exhibit 183, dated October 22, 1959, with the American postmark on the envelope
October 30, 1961. I offer it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you say 1959 and then 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. <span class="locked">'61&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is all '61?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are correct&mdash;October 22, 1959, is the date on the letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is incorrect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And on the envelope it is October 30, 1961, Vernon, Tex. Mrs.
Oswald, can you explain that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Evidently Lee put the date incorrect&mdash;because I had no
contact with Lee from the time&mdash;I had one contact with Lee from the time that
he defected to Russia. And the only contact was when he was at the Metropole
Hotel in Moscow. Then the next contact was when the State Department wrote
me his address, which was July, or June 1961. So where Lee put the 1959, I
would say it was just an error, because the postmark proves the date.</p>

<p>As I have been saying FBI instead of Secret Service&mdash;I mean it is <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. A slip of some kind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is the 1959 letter available, the Metropole Hotel letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When we go into the defection, I have letters from 1959 that I
myself have sent to Lee and have been returned, and, gentlemen, they are unopened,
and I will give you the privilege of opening my thoughts to my son.
They were returned unopened, because he was not located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I might answer your question, Mr. Dulles. We have a copy of
the Metropole letter of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Mr. Rankin, could I check&mdash;your Exhibit 182, the one you called
just before this&mdash;I gathered that you gave a date of the letter and also a date
of the postmark. Am I correct&mdash;October 2, 1961, is the date of the letter, and
October 10, 1961, is the postmark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, with regard to Exhibit 183, which bears the date October 22,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
1959, in error, with October 30, 1961, as the postmark on the envelope, I wish to
call the Commission's attention to this reference.</p>

<p>"Marina's maiden name was Prusakova. Her aunt and uncle's address in
Minsk is"&mdash;and then the address is set out in Russian. And then continuing
the same sentence&mdash;"they don't speak any English. However, her uncle is an
Army colonel soon to retire."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And that I would think would be the letter that the Secret
Service&mdash;was one of the letters that the Secret Service, as I previously stated,
had.</p>

<p>Now, may I say something here?</p>

<p>Marina uses two names&mdash;Prusakova and Nikolaevna. Whether she was married
before, or whether she uses two maiden names, I do not know. But I have
a record of both names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 183.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Rankin, don't we have a record of those two names?
Isn't one her maiden name and the other by her mother&mdash;and the other by her
stepfather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the record we have. That is what Mrs. Marina Oswald
testified to. She testified in regard to Nikolaevna. And the other name appears
on her papers as the father.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But now Lee has said in one of those letters that her name is
Nikolaevna. But then when he asked me in one of the letters to get an affidavit
of support that Marina could come to the United States, that name appeared&mdash;Nikolaevna.
Yet there are a couple of letters where he refers to her name as
Prusakova. And I have it in his handwriting&mdash;when he gave me the slip of
paper for the baptism he used Prusakova&mdash;Marina Prusakova Oswald. He did
not use the name in the letters. That is what I find peculiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The explanation was that the Prusakova was the identification
of the father, which is often done. And she explained that with regard to the
child they did not want to name June Lee Oswald with your son's name, if you
recall&mdash;that is your son did not want that. But the Russian Government insisted
that the father's name had to be shown.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I am familiar with that. I have done research on that.
In Russia the father's name is used even if it is a girl. Now, Mr. Peter Gregory&mdash;his
name is Peter Gregory, and his father's name is Peter, so his name is Peter
Peter Gregory. They always use the father's name as a second name, regardless
of sex. So June is named June Lee Oswald, which is Lee's name. And if there
were two Lees it would be Lee Lee Oswald. That I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 184 is dated November 8, 1961, and bears a postmark on
the envelope November 18, 1961. I offer it in evidence.</p>

<p>Exhibit 185 is dated November 23d, without any year on the letter itself, with
the postmark December 4, 1961, as the American postmark on the envelope. I
offer Exhibit 185.</p>

<p>Exhibit 186 is Christmas greetings and bears the date December 12, 1961,
stamped on the envelope. I offer Exhibit 186.</p>

<p>Exhibit 187 bears the date December 13, 1961, on the letter, and bears the
postmark date December 26, 1961, on the envelope. I offer Exhibit 187.</p>

<p>Exhibit 188 bears the date December 20th, without any year on the letter, and
the date January 2, 1962, stamped on the envelope. I offer Exhibit 188.</p>

<p>Exhibit 189 bears the date January 2d, and the stamped postmark on the
envelope January 11, 1962. I offer Exhibit 189.</p>

<p>Exhibit 190 bears the date January 23d, on the envelope, January 22, 1961,
written on the back of the envelope. I offer in evidence Exhibit 190.</p>

<p>Exhibit 191 bears the date January 20th, and stamped on the envelope is
January 29, 1962. I offer Exhibit 191.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These are all airmail letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They are all registered return receipt mailed. Everything I
had to sign for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Nine or 10 days apparently, it took.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That is right&mdash;about 10 days, each one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Apparently&mdash;it states "Par Avion".   But this one bears a mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
February 1, 1962, on Exhibit 192, and the letter itself is February 1, 1962. That
is pretty fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It must be 11. Isn't there a 1 left out on the other side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, it is in handwriting. So that would be pretty fast mail.
I offer Exhibit 192.</p>

<p>Exhibit 193, dated February 9, 1962, on the letter, and it is stamped on the
envelope as February 23, 1962. I offer Exhibit 193.</p>

<p>Exhibit 194 is dated February 15, 1962, on the letter, and stamped on the envelope
March 1, 1962. I offer Exhibit 194.</p>

<p>Exhibit 195 is dated February 24th, without a year date, and the envelope is
stamped March 7, 1962. I offer Exhibit 195.</p>

<p>Exhibit 196 is dated March 28th, stamped on the envelope is April 9, 1962. I
offer Exhibit 196.</p>

<p>Exhibit 197 is dated April 22d, without a year date on the letter, and stamped
on the envelope is April 28, 1962. I offer Exhibit 197.</p>

<p>Exhibit 198 is dated May 30, 1962, on the letter, and is stamped on the envelope
June 6, 19&mdash;it doesn't show clearly what the year is, but there is a 196,
and I take it is 1962. I offer Exhibit 198.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All of the documents that have just been offered in evidence
may be admitted and take the numbers assigned to them.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 180 through
198 for identification, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't believe this letter belongs with the letters. May I see
it, please? Is that a letter from Russia? I don't think so, from what I can see
from here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It purports to be, Mrs. Oswald. I hand it to you. It is Exhibit
198 you are speaking of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I'm sorry. There was another very important letter of
this size that I thought maybe became confused with the Russian letters. You
will have to forgive me, Chief Justice Warren, but this is quite a big undertaking.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. I just wanted to keep the record straight. It is all
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I ask leave, Mr. Chairman, to substitute copies in each instance.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That may be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, Mrs. Oswald, will you proceed with telling us how you
determined or concluded that there was a conspiracy between the Secret Service
people that you described and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, when I stopped&mdash;I have to remember where I stopped.
Now, am I still at the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The last I recall you were still there. You had also described,
if you remember, the offer of Mrs. Pultz to take your daughter-in-law and provide
her a home. You have said that you had not seen your daughter for quite
some time, and you tried to communicate with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes&mdash;I was trying to communicate with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you talked to Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;that was where my mail had been opened. And Mr.
Mark Lane has my mail and the photostatic copies of the mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I think the Commission would be very much interested in how
you conclude that there was a conspiracy&mdash;if you can help on that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I can help you. But I have many, many stories. I have
to start from the defection. I have a story of Lee's life at age 16 that maybe
you know about, maybe you don't. And I have many stories, gentlemen. I cannot
do all these stories in these 6 hours I have been here today. I have covered
quite a bit. I have many stories.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Why did your son defect to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I cannot answer that yes or no, sir. I am going to go through
the whole story, or it is no good. And that is what I have been doing for this
Commission all day long&mdash;giving a story.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Suppose you just make it very brief.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I cannot make it brief. I will say I am unable to make it
brief. This is my life and my son's life going down in history. And I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the opportunity to tell the story with documents, as I have been doing. I am
not going to answer yes or no, because it is no good.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Well, you use the expression "defector." I did not
use that expression.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said "so-called defector." The papers have "defector" and
blown it up.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mrs. Oswald, you have told us, though, that you believed
that Mrs. Marina Oswald and Mrs. Paine and two Secret Service agents were
in a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And I also <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. What Mr. Rankin has asked you is what led you to the belief
that there was such a conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can answer that, sir. But just to answer in one <span class="locked">sentence&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. No, you don't have to do it in one sentence. Take your own
time, but stick to that one subject, please, until we get rid of that, and then we
will go to the other things.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, it is now quarter to four. And this is a very long story.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Don't worry, we will give you the time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Would you please consider I am very emotionally upset and
tired, sir. I was up until 1 o'clock this morning fixing these papers for the
Commission. When Mr. Rankin asked me to come on Thursday, they were not
in the order they are now.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You mean you cannot go on this afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not the whole story.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, give us as much as you can of it, and we will stop
<span class="locked">whenever&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I have so far given you enough story to state this as a
fact&mdash;that I believe&mdash;I am saying as I believe, sir, because if I knew who shot
President Kennedy, I would be more than happy to tell you, and we would end
it right then and there. But there is speculation among everyone. So naturally
there is speculation by myself, and these stories I have told you are fact.</p>

<p>Marina became very unhappy with America. This I know for a fact. And
then I will say this is part of another story.</p>

<p>Marina told me at Mrs. Paine's home that she wrote to the Russian counsel
to go back to Russia because, "Lee not get work." Now, that is why Lee tried
to get a visa in Mexico. But you see, sir, I was going to tell that whole story
of that. But I will answer this&mdash;and that is what I based that on, too.</p>

<p>It was Marina who wrote to the Russian counsel for exit visas, and Lee
followed it up. That is Marina having Lee do this. And she told me herself.
Yet she states that Lee wanted to live in Russia and Cuba. But Marina wrote
to the Russian counsel, "Mama, Lee not get work." So she wanted to go back
to Russia. She liked America. She wanted to stay here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what date was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was the night in Mrs. Paine's home. I didn't tell you
that, because these other stories are important, and I was going to bring it in
for the Mexican trip. That is why I think you are confusing me. I'm sorry.
But these stories&mdash;the way I want to say it, I would not forget anything by
going in sequence. This way, when you are bringing me questions from the
Mexican story and from the defection, you are throwing my mind off.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. What story do you want to get to now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have so many stories. And I have gone through about three
or four today, complete stories.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, select one of them, please, and let's don't argue about
the order. I want you to tell your <span class="locked">story&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My energy is exhausted, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I want you to tell your story in your own way. And if this
one exhausts you, select another story, and tell that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, can you tell me what short story I can tell, Mr. Doyle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Why don't you start with&mdash;start and tell the members of the
Commission about your accident and Lee's going to Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a very long story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. I know. But start it, and if you get tired at all, you advise the
Commission, and I am certain <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will have something very important to this Commission that
I would like to say, that would take up some time.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, I spoke with you, I think it was Thursday, December 6th, and I
told you that since it was publicly known I was going to appear before the
Warren Commission, that I would like to have protection, as you recall. I did
not get protection, sir. And so the next morning I called you, approximately
9 o'clock, in the morning and told you that I didn't have protection, and I was
very concerned. And this would have been Friday, the second call, and that
I was going to the bank, to my safety deposit vault, and get the necessary
papers. And I definitely wanted complete surveillance, because the papers were
going to be with me in my home, and the public knew I was going to testify,
and I wanted that protection.</p>

<p>Now, you said, you would get in touch with Mr. Sorrels, sir, and have Mr.
Sorrel's call me, which he did approximately an hour after my request to you
that I did not have protection. Mr. Sorrels called me and said "Mrs. Oswald,
I understand that you want to go to the bank and get your important papers
out of the bank, and you have requested protection."</p>

<p>I said, "Yes. I thought I had protection last night. I woke up 4 o'clock in
the morning with all the lights lit, getting papers together and cleaning the
house." Because the telephone started to ring consistently.</p>

<p>I would have never done that if I would have known I didn't have protection.
I was leaving myself wide open.</p>

<p>So he said, "Well, is your attorney in town?"</p>

<p>I said, "No, he is not."</p>

<p>He said, "May I suggest this, Mrs. Oswald"&mdash;first, he said, "What do you
intend to do with the papers?"</p>

<p>I said, "The papers will stay with me."</p>

<p>He said, "Is your attorney in there?"</p>

<p>I said, "No, sir, he is an out of town attorney."</p>

<p>He said, "May I suggest this. May we get a large brown envelope and put
sealing wax on it, and you put the papers in our safety deposit vault."</p>

<p>I said, "No, sir, those papers do not leave my hands. I have had an understanding
with Mr. J. Lee Rankin that the papers were going to stay with me,
and that I would have complete surveillance while the papers were in my home.
Now, Mr. Sorrels, I want that surveillance. I am very uneasy."</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Oswald"&mdash;this was approximately 10 o'clock in the morning&mdash;"Mrs.
Oswald, I will not be able to have anyone there before 1 o'clock."</p>

<p>I said, "That is just fine."</p>

<p>Mr. Mike Howard came out at 1 o'clock. We did some errands. I had to buy
some luggage, and a few little things for the trip. Then we had supper. And
at 5:30 we picked up the papers, because on Friday in Fort Worth, Tex., the
bank opens from 4 to 6&mdash;on Friday evening. So we picked up the papers before
6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Now, I thought I had protection that night. I had protection that night until
12 o'clock. And then I understand that the Fort Worth police were circling
the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Now, that is not complete protection.</p>

<p>I am a government witness, with important papers. And Mr. Rankin had&mdash;I
requested protection&mdash;suppose someone had come to the door, or just shot through
my home? The police circling three or four blocks away is not complete
protection.</p>

<p>So Saturday morning I wanted to go out to breakfast. I kept opening the
door and looking through the windows. And I never did see any men circling
the neighborhood. There was nobody around. At 10:30 this morning I was
still doing that. And by the way, a police car passed by and I hailed him and
asked him if he could check in the neighborhood for the Secret Service, if they
were circling the neighborhood&mdash;because I want to put my garbage out, and I
needed to go out, didn't have breakfast. He said he didn't know what the Secret
Service looked like, and he offered to come to the back and put the garbage out
for me, which this Fort Worth policeman did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
So at 11 o'clock I called Mr. Mike Howard's home. His wife answered the
phone.</p>

<p>I said, "I am very uneasy. I don't have protection. I have been looking for
Secret Service men all morning."</p>

<p>I was going out on the porch&mdash;I was opening the screen door and going out
on the porch. There is a school ground opposite my house. And nobody ever
came. I was not under protection.</p>

<p>So she said, "Mrs. Oswald, they have their orders."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, where is Mr. Howard?"</p>

<p>She said, "He is on his way to your home."</p>

<p>This was Saturday, at approximately 11:45. Well, I have it written down.
11:45.</p>

<p>So Mr. Mike Howard when I told him that I was stranded, and could not go
out to breakfast, and there was things I needed to do, he realized I was very
upset, and I had a legitimate complaint, and he realized I was on my way to
Washington.</p>

<p>So in my home he called Mr. Sorrels, who is a special agent in charge of the
Secret Service and Mr. Sorrels was not at home. He talked to his daughter.
And he said, "It is most important. Would you have him call me?"</p>

<p>So he sat in my home and waited for the call. About half an hour later Mr.
Sorrels called.</p>

<p>He said, "Mr. Sorrels. I want to know what to do on this particular case?"</p>

<p>And there was some conversation back and forth. And it went on back and
forth conversation.</p>

<p>So I said, "I am getting very upset about not knowing the entire conversation.
I want to tell Mr. Sorrels that if he doesn't have the authority, to give me
complete protection, I want to know the man over him, so I can get complete
protection."</p>

<p>Mr. Mike Howard said, "He heard you, Mrs. Oswald."</p>

<p>So I don't know what went on on the other end of the line.</p>

<p>But Mr. Mike Howard was on the spot.</p>

<p>He said, "Well, Mr. Sorrels, it is this way. She is going to Washington, and
Mrs. Oswald wants to go here and wants to go there. And if we are not around
to take her, she will certainly complain when she gets to Washington."</p>

<p>So I am assuming now&mdash;I am speculating, like everybody else&mdash;that Mr. Sorrels
probably could have said, "Well, let her think she has protection," because
Mr. Mike Howard had to come back in front of me, to his superior, and say,
"That is no good. She might want to go some place, so we have to be here. I
want to know what to do."</p>

<p>And then I got protection.</p>

<p>Now, isn't that peculiar&mdash;that I am a witness, with important papers, and
supposed to be under surveillance, and I am not getting protection?</p>

<p>I would like to know the answer to these things. And Mr. Rankin himself
called Mr. Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I talked to Mr. Kelley.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry&mdash;but I knew you had placed a call, because Mr.
Sorrels called me and said you had placed a call.</p>

<p>So why didn't I have complete protection?</p>

<p>There is a lot of "why's." There are a lot of "why's" that have to be answered.</p>

<p>Now, the man last night that met me at the airport&mdash;there were two Secret
Service men. One of the NBC men, I think it is&mdash;I am not quite sure&mdash;was at
the station. He asked me questions, and he knows about all of this, because
he was in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>I would know his name if you would say it. Dave Benoski, I believe it is.</p>

<p>But he asked me a question. He said, "Mrs. Oswald, have you seen your
daughter-in-law?"</p>

<p>I said, "No, I have not seen my daughter-in-law since Thanksgiving Day."</p>

<p>"Well, is it the Secret Service who have kept you from seeing your daughter-in-law?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Yes, it is the Secret Service who has kept me from seeing my
daughter-in-law."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Which, to me, is a fact.</p>

<p>So in the car, with your two Secret Service agents, one was Mr. Brown and
one was&mdash;I am very bad about names&mdash;he said, "Mrs. Oswald, what makes you
want to blame the Secret Service? The time to have blamed the Secret Service
was when it happened."</p>

<p>And I said, "I did blame the Secret Service when it happened. I made a
report in Fort Worth, Tex., about that."</p>

<p>And I said, "The question was asked me." I answered him truthfully, "Yes,
that the Secret Service have kept me from my daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>So he said, "Well, has it occurred to you that your daughter-in-law doesn't
want to see you?"</p>

<p>And I said, "She made the statement in Washington, the first time I have
known of that, from my daughter-in-law's lips, that she did not want to see me."</p>

<p>And Mr. Sorrels never told me.</p>

<p>Now, again, I don't believe this Secret Service man had the right to quiz me
like he did. I was very upset. Mr. Doyle can verify the fact. When he came
to the hotel I was on the verge of tears, because of this quizzing.</p>

<p>The point I want to make&mdash;he said, "Isn't it true that you have had complete
protection by the Secret Service for the last 2 weeks, ever since the testifying
began?"</p>

<p>I said, "No, sir; it is not true."</p>

<p>Now, where does he get the idea I have been under surveillance for 2 weeks?
I don't understand these things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Tell them about the defection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Would you please consider that I can't go any more today?
It is 4 o'clock. The defection is a very long and important story that leads into
a story where a recruiting officer at age 16 tried to get Lee to enlist into the
Marines. And it is a very important story, gentlemen. And I think you would
be quite interested in it for the record.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will recess now until tomorrow. Mr. Doyle, I understand
in the morning you have a court appearance that you must make. But you will
be available at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Two o'clock. Your Honor.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well, we will recess now until 2 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I appreciate it, because I was up until late last night trying
to get the papers for you. It wouldn't do you any good if I break down.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, we don't want to overdo the situation in any way. So
we will adjourn until 2 o'clock tomorrow.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARGUERITE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 2 p.m. on February 11, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Hale
Boggs, Representative Gerald R. Ford, and Allen W. Dulles, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel; John Doyle, attorney for Mrs. Marguerite Oswald; and Leon
Jaworski, special counsel to the attorney general of Texas.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The Commission will come to order. Are we ready to proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. If it please Your <span class="locked">Honor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Doyle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Mr. Mark Lane is present as counsel, as I understand, for Mrs.
Oswald. Although I have not talked to Mrs. Oswald about the matter, as I
understand it Mr. Lane represented her from time to time, in one capacity or
another in the past.</p>

<p>I do not know the particulars. Mrs. Oswald or Mr. Lane could better advise
the Commission about the point.</p>

<p>Of course my designation was at the request of Mrs. Oswald to act in her
behalf, since there was no counsel of her choice present at the time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. True.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. In view of the appearance&mdash;I wonder if it might be straightened
out&mdash;if Mr. Lane wishes to enter his appearance in the matter.</p>

<p>Of course I would immediately respectfully move for leave to withdraw.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, what is your wish?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, Mr. Lane is just here for a few hours, Chief Justice
Warren. He flew in just for a few hours. He is catching a 4 o'clock plane out.
And I thought&mdash;he had asked permission just to sit in for these few hours.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Either he represents you or he does not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he does not represent me.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Then we will excuse Mr. Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Mr. Chief <span class="locked">Justice&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Lane, now really&mdash;either you are here as the attorney
for Mrs. Oswald or you are not entitled to be in this room&mdash;one of the two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. May I ask, Mr. Chief Justice, if it is permissible for me to function
at Mrs. Oswald's request as her counsel together with Mr. Doyle, just for an
hour or two, and then be excused.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Doyle has said that if you are her attorney he is not.
And Mr. Doyle is doing this as a public service. We must respect his views in
the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. I see. I did explain to Mr. Doyle before I came into the room
exactly what the situation was. It was not until now that I understood his
response.</p>

<p>Under those circumstances, I wonder if I might confer with Mrs. Oswald for
just a minute or two.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. If Mrs. Oswald wants to, she may.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, thank you.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You may take another room, if you wish.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lane</span>. Under the circumstances, since I do have to leave and I will not
be able to be here for the rest of the afternoon's session and for subsequent
sessions&mdash;under those circumstances, since Mr. Doyle will not remain on
jointly with me, I will at this time withdraw.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well. Now, we will continue. Mr. Rankin, you may
continue with the hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, could you tell us first now, while you are fresh,
about this conspiracy that you said that you knew about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;If you would like me to do it now. I was going to lead
up to all the fundamentals, to my way of thinking. I have no proof, because
naturally if I did I don't think we would be here.</p>

<p>But I feel like there is a lot of speculation about everything.</p>

<p>My way of thinking is because the involvement of myself at Six Flags and
the way I was treated, as I have already put into the testimony, and as I stated
yesterday, also, that I was supposed to be under protective custody, and I
was not.</p>

<p>I wonder why I didn't have protective custody, why I am not important
enough, with papers out of the vault, and appearing before the hearing, that
Mr. Sorrels, head of the Secret Service, didn't give me protective custody, even
though you, yourself, Mr. Rankin, required it.</p>

<p>These are the things I have to face that to me are very unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, it is such a serious charge to say that these two Secret
Service men and your son and&mdash;I didn't understand for sure whether you included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
anyone else in your charge&mdash;were involved in a conspiracy to assassinate
the President.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, <span class="locked">no&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And your daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is not my statement. I said I thought that we have a plot
in our own government, and that there is a high official involved. And I am
thinking that probably these Secret Service men are part of it.</p>

<p>Now, I didn't say in a conspiracy&mdash;make it as strong as you did. I have made
it strong. But I am under the impression that possibly there is a leak in our
own government. And when I come to these papers&mdash;and I specifically yesterday
morning asked about Senator Tower.</p>

<p>Now, I am not throwing any reflection on Senator Tower. But he made the
statement in the paper that he had a letter from the State Department saying
that Lee had renounced his citizenship.</p>

<p>Now, you see, I don't have that paper with me. I had it yesterday morning.
But his whole quotes&mdash;the dates and everything of the letter that he was supposed
to have had is not in correspondence with the dates that I have from the
State Department papers which you gentlemen know that I have all these papers
from the State Department. Nothing corresponds with what I have.</p>

<p>So I wanted to know and see this letter that Senator Tower claims he has.
It could have been that it was an error in newspaper reporting, and I will say
in slang he could have shot his mouth off, because he said he would not help the
boy when the boy wrote him the letter.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Chairman, I saw the letter that Lee Harvey Oswald
wrote to Senator Tower the day after the assassination. And I believe I also
saw the response that he received from one of the agencies of the Federal
Government. Senator Tower had the original of the letter. If it is not in our
Commission files, I am sure it is available for the Commission files&mdash;along with,
whatever exchange of correspondence he had with the Department of State
concerning the matter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, what is of utmost interest to me in this particular
case is if there is such a letter, and it does not correspond with anything that
I have, I would like to know who in the State Department wrote this particular
letter.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I would not know who in the State Department wrote the
letter. I would suspect it was the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs,
Fred Dutton, I believe.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not suspecting, because I have many, many letters from
the State Department, and I also have something else that I will present that
maybe would be another party involved. There is very conflicting testimony.</p>

<p>You must realize that I went to Washington in 1961 and was in conference with
three officials. And this was another Administration.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know much about politics, gentlemen. But I do know a little from
the news.</p>

<p>Lee's defection was in one Administration&mdash;right?</p>

<p>And now this is of another Administration, the Kennedy Administration. And
there could be a leak in the State Department. That is not impossible.</p>

<p>So I have two instances that I, myself, am not satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. A leak is so much different from a conspiracy to assassinate the
President, though.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, but this leak this could be the party involved in the
assassination of the President&mdash;the high officials I am speaking of. I cannot
pin it down to one sentence, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, you named the Secret Service men, two of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, do you have anything that shows you that either of those
men were involved in the conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will answer that emphatically no. What I have stated is the
way they treated me, sir. I elaborated the way these two men treated me&mdash;correct?
I did that testimony yesterday.</p>

<p>So I have to consider these two men. I will put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Let's consider Marina Oswald. Do you have anything that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
show that she was involved in any conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel like Marina is involved and also Mrs. Paine, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, what do you have in that regard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right&mdash;because Marina&mdash;now this I have said to Mr. Jack
Lengett, who is a New York Times newspaperman a long time ago. And I was
ashamed to say it to anyone else. And I didn't tell it to him for a long time.</p>

<p>The story yesterday at the Six Flags, when I said to you Marina shrugged
me off, and the second time she shrugged me off. The second time she said&mdash;and
I would not say it now unless I had told Mr. Jack Lengett&mdash;she said, "You no
have job."</p>

<p>In other words, since Marina was being offered a home, then you go to&mdash;"You
don't have job."</p>

<p>Before she was satisfied to take $863 and live with me. I was giving her my
money and giving her my love. And then, "You no have job."</p>

<p>I am trying to show you the disposition of my daughter-in-law. I love her.
But I am trying to show you that there is two sides. I told you how she hit
the little girl with the comb. "Mama, I no need you, Mama. You don't have
job."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why does that show she was involved in any conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because I am going to try to show there is discrepancies all
along. She was not supposed to speak English.</p>

<p>I testified that I, myself, questioned her for an FBI agent. I acted as interpreter.
So Marina did know English and understand English. So that is a
question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I thought you said she spoke broken English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Broken English. But she is not supposed to speak English
at all, until now that she has learned English. That has been publicized over
and over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you think she could understand English fluently?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I also told you when she lived with me that month
in my home, how we conversed and talked. And yet the impression is that
Marina came here and didn't speak English at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How does that show she conspired to assassinate the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because Marina now is not happy. Marina was very happy,
I explained to you, the month she was with me in the beginning that they had
rented this house. And then Marina made friends, very, very many friends.
And Marina became discontented with Lee. Lee could not give her the things
she wanted, what he told her about America. And Marina now has become
discontented with me. I don't mean now&mdash;I mean at the Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mama always had a big heart. I quit a job to help these children, and
that is perfectly all right. That is my nature.</p>

<p>But then, when she has somebody else, you are pushed aside.</p>

<p>I am trying to show this. And, as I go along&mdash;I cannot help but face this,
gentlemen, it is a fact. I cannot help but face these things.</p>

<p>So I am under the impression&mdash;and this is speculation, like anything else&mdash;circumstantial
evidence, let's say.</p>

<p>I am just a layman. That is what you have against my son. Nobody saw
him with a rifle shoot the President. So you have mostly circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<p>I have to think of all these things, who might be involved in this.</p>

<p>The Secret Service men, surely you will admit, did not guard our President
properly.</p>

<p>Now, that was also stated in the newspaper by, I think it is, Secret Service
Judge Baughman&mdash;am I saying that right? He is the one that&mdash;how Lee got
out of the building, and why the President&mdash;there are many, many people that
wonder. So I, too, am wondering.</p>

<p>So I say that President Kennedy was improperly guarded. And I am not
the only one that says that, sir. So I have to consider that. I have to consider
the way I, myself, was treated at Six Flags for the three days.</p>

<p>When I came here today&mdash;I have these notes, something very important
about that particular incident at Six Flags, to back up my story with a witness.
You don't have to take my word for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What else is there now in regard to Marina that caused you
to think she conspired to kill President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;because everything is laid out in Mrs. Paine's home and
Marina's home. The gun was in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, that doesn't make Marina do it, does it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, but Marina told the police that the gun was there the
night before. She saw the gun in the garage the night before. She didn't
see Lee take it that morning. But she made a statement that she saw the gun
the night before.</p>

<p>The pictures of Lee with the rifle came from that home. If Lee is going
to assassinate the President or anybody else, is he going to have photographs
laying all around with the gun? No, sir.</p>

<p>And there is too much evidence pointing to the assassination and my son
being the guilty one in this particular house.</p>

<p>All through the testimony, sir, everything has come from this particular house.
And so I am a thinking person, I have to think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Why does that show that Marina had anything to do with the
conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, we are speculating, let's say. Marina is not happy. Lee
can't give her any money and things. And she has made friends with these
Russian folks that have cars and homes. And they are not happy because this
Russian girl doesn't have anything. They are not happy about that.</p>

<p>And I am trying to show the disposition of the girl.</p>

<p>I love my daughter-in-law even now. Believe me, it is a sore spot to have
to say this. But I have to face these facts of what I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You realize it is a very serious charge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And it is also a serious charge that my son is the
assassin of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>You see, we have two sides here. It is a very serious charge, because no
one saw him shoot the President. And yet this is an international affair.
And the conclusion has come to the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald has
shot President Kennedy, and he alone. Lee Harvey Oswald, or Mr. J. Lee
Rankin, or anyone in this room could not have been in that many places in 29
minutes time. It is utterly impossible.</p>

<p>And this has been gone over by hundreds of people. There are investigations.
I have 1,500 letters, sir&mdash;not just letters of sympathy&mdash;people that are
investigating this. And I don't read all thoroughly, and I am a layman. But
he step by step has been taken, from what the reports said&mdash;that he was on the
sixth floor, and then they saw him in the cafeteria drinking a Coca Cola, and
the President came. Then he had to leave the building. He had so many
blocks to walk before he caught a bus. He had to board the bus, he had to pay
his fare, he had to get out of the bus, then he walked a few blocks, then he
caught a taxicab, paid the taxi man, then he walked a few blocks, went to his
home and got a coat. Then he walked a few more blocks and shot the policeman.
Then he walked a few more blocks and he was in the theater.</p>

<p>In 29 minutes time it cannot be done.</p>

<p>So I am convinced my son, and my son alone, if he is involved&mdash;I am a human
being, and I say my son could have shot the President, and he could have
been involved. I am not the type mother to think that he is perfect and he
could not do it. But I say he did not do it alone&mdash;if he did it. Because it is
utterly impossible.</p>

<p>And I do not believe my son did it.</p>

<p>I think my son was framed because, gentlemen&mdash;would his rifle be in the
sixth floor window of the depository&mdash;unless you want to say my son was
completely out of his mind. And yet there has been no statement to that effect.
Wade has publicly said on the television when it happened that he is sane, he is
well reasoned, he knows what he did. And Lee never did break, with his black
eyes. He kept saying he was innocent. And yet in 12 hours time he was proven
guilty. That doesn't make sense to me, an ordinary layman. So I have to
consider who is involved.</p>

<p>Now, I am telling you that this girl was not happy with her situation. She
had turned against me twice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
You, yourself, yesterday said that she testified that I told her to tear up the
picture. God give me the grace&mdash;I did no such thing. My testimony is true.</p>

<p>So now she has lied there, I have found out.</p>

<p>And every evidence of any importance has come from this house. I have to
face that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What else do you have that shows that she had any part in
the conspiracy to assassinate the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I am under the impression that probably she&mdash;I think
Lee is an agent. I have always thought that, and I have as much circumstantial
evidence that Lee is an agent, that the Dallas police has that he is a murderer,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you base that on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well. I am going to tell my story. I have it all there. That
is what I base it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us in summary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I don't think I want to tell it to you that way, because
I cannot, almost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is a very serious charge, that he was an agent, too.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, fine. So all right.</p>

<p>If I feel that way, sir, don't I have the right, the American way, to speak up
and to tell you what I feel? Isn't that my privilege?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes. But can't you tell us what you base it on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I will, as I go along, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that the only way you can tell it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't see how I can say to you I know he is an agent, and
I have papers. I want to tell the whole story. I still have more papers. I
have documents that I know you do not have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you told us all that you know that would bear on your
claim that Marina Oswald <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Had a part in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had a part in it or conspired to assassinate the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;I cannot prove it. And I cannot prove Lee is an
agent. I cannot prove these things.</p>

<p>But I have facts that may lead up to them. I cannot prove it, because if I
did we would not be having this Commission, sir. I could say who shot President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So in both cases of the agent&mdash;Lee being an agent, your son,
and Marina Oswald and the Secret Service agents or anybody else conspiring
with him for the assassination of President Kennedy, that is just suspicions.
You cannot prove it&mdash;is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would not use the word suspicion, because I am not the type
person to be suspicious and imagine things.</p>

<p>You may think so, because I am a woman. And this is my son. But my
children were never tied to my apron strings.</p>

<p>And I can prove to you, in his defection in 1959, I made the statement that
Lee, as an individual, had the right to think and do what he wanted to. They
even said he was a Communist. If that is what he studied, and that is what
he wanted to do, I accepted that, because that was his privilege as an individual.
And that is public in 1959, my statement, which shows that I am not the sobbing
mother kind because he has gone to Russia, and cry about it. I acknowledge
that.</p>

<p>I have acknowledged that if the children, like Lee, went to Dallas, as I testified
that yesterday, and didn't tell me he was going to Dallas&mdash;I don't grieve and
lose my sleep over that. I have accepted that fact, because when Lee and
Marina got ready to come to me that would be fine. In the meantime, I still
have to live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you telling the Commission that your son was part of a
conspiracy to assassinate the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am saying that I realize that my son could possibly be
part&mdash;yes&mdash;I realize he is a human being and he could possibly be in this, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you saying he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I do not know. I am saying possibly he is involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you are saying possibly Marina was involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, exactly what I am trying to say. If I had proof, sir, I
would give the proof in an affidavit and this case would be closed, like Mr.
Wade said.</p>

<p>But I have as much right to my way of thinking as Mr. Wade has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are saying that possibly the Secret Service agents were
involved, too? You don't have any proof of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is exactly what I have been trying to say. I have told
you how I was treated, which has given me cause for this particular way of
thinking&mdash;because I believe that my son is innocent. And I think that is the
purpose of this Commission, is to hear all witnesses and arrive at a conclusion.
Am I not right, gentlemen?</p>

<p>So this is my way of thinking. So grant me my way of thinking. If I am
wrong, fine. But you may learn something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about the high official now. Can you tell us who that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I wish I did know. I have my own idea about that.
I would rather not&mdash;because it is a high official&mdash;I would rather not give a
name.</p>

<p>But I have my own very strong suspicions as to the official who he might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We would appreciate your telling us within this group what
you think.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fine&mdash;and I expect to, Mr. Rankin. I am a person that is very
outspoken, as you know by now, and I will certainly do that.</p>

<p>But will you grant me the privilege first of finding out the name of the man
in the State Department that wrote the letter to Senator Tower, because it is
an incorrect&mdash;it is incorrect&mdash;the whole testimony is incorrect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We will get that correspondence for you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right. I was going to go into something else, but while
we are here, I will continue this.</p>

<p>And this, to me, will be in this line. And I think very important to you
gentlemen. And you do not have a copy of what I am going to show you.
I am the only person that has this copy.</p>

<p>I am sorry to take time, but these were not copied, sir. We sealed them up,
and we were going to have them copied this afternoon. But I can get to this
particular one. This is the defection. I have much more testimony than this.
I have testimony, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you think that you can tell us the name of the high official
you spoke about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I think so. And I am going to tell you. But please do not
ask me at this particular moment. I do not think this is the proper time for
me to&mdash;it is just&mdash;I have no proof. Understand? As I said, it is my right to
think and my analysis of the papers I have. I have papers where I can come
to a conclusion, just like you gentlemen are going to have papers and witnesses
and come to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Now, this particular <span class="locked">instance&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if we could not possibly explore that agent matter.
I am very much interested in that. I cannot be here tomorrow. We laid all the
groundwork for that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Dulles would like to know her reasons for believing that
he was an agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have two very long stories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have to be absent, unfortunately, tomorrow, so I would like
very much to have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If you could go into that question, Mrs. Oswald, because Mr.
Dulles is not going to be here tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We have everything just so, and yet when we come here we
don't have it. The International Rescue Committee is what I am looking for.</p>

<p>I have also the original application from the Albert Schweitzer coming that
you gentlemen do not have.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Let's stay on one thing, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right. I am a little excited now, because I meant to go
story by story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Gentlemen, I have at least four more stories to tell&mdash;two I don't think there
are some parts you possibly can know about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, if you could tell about why you think your son was an
agent, it will help to get that taken care of this afternoon while Mr. Dulles
can be with us. That is why I asked you that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. We have a special file. You see, gentlemen, all
morning long I was in the backroom and we were copying things. We had
everything just so. So now I don't know what condition they are in. Mr. Doyle
and I worked on the papers again last night and we had them just so. And
then when they were copied, evidently they were mixed up again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We tried to have you present so that would not happen. Mrs.
Oswald. I guess you didn't accomplish that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, they did take it into the other room, and we saw that they
took it.</p>

<p>Well, I can be telling the story about it.</p>

<p>It is the International Rescue Committee, and a telegram.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Lee&mdash;this is going to be real short, Chief Justice
Warren. It is going to continue this one story. And then I will go into the
defection&mdash;is that right&mdash;because this will continue that.</p>

<p>A letter from Lee asking me to go to the Red Cross in Vernon&mdash;I was on a
case there&mdash;and asking me to show the letter to the lady at the Red Cross. And
this is from Moscow. This is the letter from Moscow. And telling her that
all exit visas and everything had been documented and he is ready to come home,
but he needs help financially to come home.</p>

<p>Evidently you have that information. That I know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. So when I entered the Vernon Red Cross&mdash;now, this came
with Lee's letter, Chief Justice Warren&mdash;the letter you have there direct from
Moscow. That is why I have it, sir&mdash;because it was in Lee's letter asking me
to go to the Red Cross in Vernon. So I have the original from Moscow.</p>

<p>I told the young lady, showed her the letter and showed her the paper. And
I said, "Would you find out, please, the address of the International Rescue
Committee? My son is in Russia and asked me to contact you."</p>

<p>She said, "What is your son doing in Russia?"</p>

<p>I said, "I don't know."</p>

<p>"You are his mother and you don't know what he is doing in Russia?"</p>

<p>I said, "Young lady, I said I do not know what he is doing in Russia."</p>

<p>"Well, I think anybody goes to Russia doesn't need any help to get back,
they should stay over there."</p>

<p>So I said, "I am not interested in your personal opinion. I need help. Would
you please contact, give me the address of the International Rescue Committee
so I can continue to try to get money for my son to come home?"</p>

<p>She did not know of any address for the International Rescue Committee.</p>

<p>I asked her if she had a private line to Wichita Falls, which was approximately
40 miles away, which would be the next big city. She called Wichita
Falls, and they did not know the address of the international committee.</p>

<p>So I called Robert and told Robert what I had and asked him to try to find
out the address of the International Rescue Committee. However, he gave me
no satisfaction.</p>

<p>Now, I sent a telegram&mdash;and you know this part of it&mdash;to the State Department,
asking&mdash;I told them I was in a small town, Vernon, Tex., and I had
received a letter from Lee asking me to get the address and help from the
International Rescue Committee. But being a small town I had no success&mdash;could
they help me out?</p>

<p>So they sent a telegram back with the address of the International Rescue
Committee. That you have.</p>

<p>And this is Lee's letter&mdash;that goes with the other part.</p>

<p>Now, this young lady was very, very regalish. She didn't want to help
anybody going to Russia. So when I received the telegram from the State
Department, it was on a Saturday. I called her that morning. I was delayed
4 or 5 days. And to me it was very important, since my son and daughter-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
had all documents finished with to get the money to come home, because I
wanted that baby to be born here.</p>

<p>So I called her at her home and told her that I had the address from the
State Department of the International Rescue Committee, and would she be so
kind enough as to come to the office and write the letter for me.</p>

<p>She said, "Well, Mrs. Oswald, I don't have a key."</p>

<p>This is on a Saturday morning and she is in the courthouse.</p>

<p>I said, "Do you mean to tell me you are in charge of the Red Cross and you
don't have a key?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, young lady, you have delayed me 4 days, and I don't like your attitude.
I am going to ask you especially to make a point to come to the office and get
this in the mail for me. It is very important."</p>

<p>So, reluctantly, after much persuasion, she came.</p>

<p>So she wrote the letter to the International Rescue Committee, and handed
it to me, and I mailed that letter&mdash;I mailed the letter.</p>

<p>This is dated January 22, 1962.</p>

<p>So she called me&mdash;her name&mdash;Mrs. Harwell. She is the only woman in the
Red Cross office in Vernon, Tex.</p>

<p>She called me and told me she had received word from the International
Rescue Committee. She read me this letter. So I said to Mrs. Harwell, "Do
you mind if I take the letter, because I am very forgetful?"</p>

<p>So she took a scissors, gentlemen, and she cut this part out, which was her
title and her address&mdash;it was addressed to her. This lady wanted no part of
anybody in Russia&mdash;understand? So she cut this out.</p>

<p>But on the back page was the name. But that is why this space is here&mdash;she
cut it out.</p>

<p>Now, the letter reads: "Since we had a call from the State Department on
Mr. Oswald's case, your communication of January 14th did not come as a
surprise."</p>

<p>So this young lady has followed up with a letter of her own to the International
Rescue Committee.</p>

<p>"Since we have had a call from the State Department, your letter does not
come as a surprise."</p>

<p>I mailed the first letter, and it was just&mdash;so she followed up her feelings
about a boy in Russia.</p>

<p>Now, why does the State Department dicker with me&mdash;that is not the word&mdash;and
then see fit to put in a personal call to the International Rescue Committee?</p>

<p>I would like to know who from the State Department called the International
Rescue Committee.</p>

<p>There is my information there that I requested. Why is a call necessary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that shows there was a conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am wondering and questioning why a call is necessary, a
call, when they had contacted&mdash;and I am showing you what I have here. I
don't see any necessity of the State Department to call the International Rescue
Committee.</p>

<p>And, gentlemen, you have a copy of this&mdash;Lee will not be helped.</p>

<p>I would like to know who called the International Rescue Committee from
the State Department&mdash;yes, sir, I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, but you don't think that shows there is a conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, no&mdash;now. Mr. Rankin, don't pin me down everything I
say to the word conspiracy. I am trying to analyze a whole condensed program
of things that are not correct. I am telling you about this. It could
be just a simple thing, that he called. But I would like to know who called
when it wasn't necessary to make a call, and Lee was not going to get the
money. Read the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The reason I ask you about the conspiracy is because that is
such a serious charge. And, as you say, if you could prove that, that would
decide everything around here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right. And I am going to see if I cannot show you
these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If you are speculating, which you have a right to do, that is
something different.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I have explained that I am speculating, that I have
all these documents, that some of them don't make sense. That is what I
am trying to tell you. I mentioned that before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are not trying to say to the Commission that you have
the proof that there was a conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have emphatically stated that I do not have the proof,
because if I had the proof I would have an affidavit and give you gentlemen
the proof. I made that clear two or three times. I wish I did have the
proof, sir.</p>

<p>I think I said yesterday&mdash;it doesn't surprise me that there may be someone
in our State Department or some official who would have part in this. He
is a human being just like we are. He may have a title, but that doesn't
make him a man back of the title.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is this conspiracy now, Mr. Rankin? Is this the conspiracy
to do away with the President, or is this a different conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The conspiracy I was asking about was the conspiracy, she
said, about the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>And she said that it involved the two Secret Service agents and her daughter-in-law
and her son. That is the one I was asking about.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And Mrs. Paine. I feel like the facts have come from this
particular source.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, as I understand she says now that she is speculating
as to that being a possibility.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, Mr. Rankin. I have not changed my testimony, if
you are implying that. I may not have put it in a position you understood.
Because as I say, I certainly did not mean to imply that I had proof, because
if I had proof I would not be sitting here taking all my energy and trying
to show you this little by little. I would have had an affidavit and show
you the proof. So if you want to call it speculation, call it speculation. I
don't care what you call it. But I am not satisfied in my mind that things
are according to Hoyle. And I believe that my son is innocent. And I also
realize that my son could be involved. But I have no way of knowing these
things unless I analyze the papers that I have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The Commission would like to know what you base your assumption
that your son was an agent on. Could you help us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Would you like me to go into this story&mdash;I will start with
my son's life from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can't we get down <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, we cannot. I am sorry. This is my life. I cannot
survive in this world unless I know I have my American way of life and
can start from the very beginning. I have to work into this. I cannot
answer these questions like in a court, yes or no. And I will not answer
yes or no. I want to tell you the story. And that is the only way you can
get a true picture. I am the accused mother of this man, and I have family
and grandchildren, and Marina, my daughter-in-law. And I am going to do
everything I can to try and prove he is innocent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, now, Mrs. Oswald, you are not claiming before this
Commission that there was anything back at the beginning, at the early
childhood of your son, in which you thought he was an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;at age 16.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, why don't you start with age 16, then.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, aren't you gentlemen&mdash;I have a letter from you, Mr.
Rankin. Aren't you gentlemen interested in my son's life from the very
beginning? I think you should, because it has been exploited in all the
magazines and papers. And this is not my son is what I am trying to say.
He is not a perfect boy, and I am not a perfect woman. But I can show a
different side of Lee Harvey Oswald, which I hope to do to this Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, I plan to ask you about his early life and these other
parts. But I thought it would be helpful if you would be willing to do it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
tell the Commission, while Mr. Dulles is here, what you base this claim upon
that your son was an agent of the Government.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, and I would be happy to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If you have to go to when he was 16 years old as the first
point, that will be fine.</p>

<p>But if you could cover that&mdash;then we will go on to the other things.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right. I have your word that you will let me have my
life story from early childhood and Lee's life story from early childhood.</p>

<p>Now, I will start from age 16. Is that satisfactory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you very much. We were in New Orleans, La., at this
particular time. On or about October 5th or 7th&mdash;and you have this, gentlemen,
as my proof, that I am telling a true story, and I will have witnesses that
will be called&mdash;is a <span class="locked">letter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What year, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said 1959&mdash;I am sorry. 1955. No, wait now. 1956&mdash;when
we left New Orleans is 1956. Am I not correct? I am a little excited now,
because of what happened before. The <span class="locked">note&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He joined the Marines in 1956. Does that help you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. Wait. We have a note from the Beauregard School
by me that I was going to San Diego. Do you have the note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We do.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I see that note, please? And that is approximately
October 5th or the 7th, I think it is, 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think you moved to Fort Worth with Lee in September 1956.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. So it was in '55. I think that is correct. Let me see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We are handing you this book that we received from the
State of Louisiana that is Commission's Exhibit No. 365, and turn to page 11 and
you will find the note you referred to.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the school. All right, gentlemen, this is a surprise. This
is my note, isn't, to the school, that I am moving to San Diego. And it has
been blasted in all the papers how I moved around, and I was going to San Diego.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I had nothing to do with this note, nothing whatsoever.</p>

<p>Lee, my son, wrote the note&mdash;on or about October 5th or the 7th&mdash;October 7th.
And now comes the story why he wrote the note.</p>

<p>If you will see here, this is Lee's handwriting, to the letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence that note on page 11.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 199, and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had nothing to do with this note.</p>

<p>Now, I am working at Kreeger's Specialty Shop, 800 and something Canal
Street in New Orleans, La. I received a telephone call from the principal of
the Beauregard School saying. "Mrs. Oswald, I understand you are going to
leave town, and we are awfully sorry to lose Lee."</p>

<p>Of course now, gentlemen, I am working and this is news to me.</p>

<p>So I said&mdash;I kind of went along with it a little bit.</p>

<p>Lee came into this shop later on that day. Miss Lillian New, I think her
name was, who is manager of Kreeger's Shop, and has been for years&mdash;she will
witness this.</p>

<p>He said, "Mother, I have quit school."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You say when the school authorities asked you, you sort of
went along with it. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When the lady called me and said that, "I understand you are
leaving town, Mrs. Oswald."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, because there was a switchboard, and my job was in
jeopardy, I don't know the exact words, but I said&mdash;I had to be kind of vague
about it and not discuss it. I knew I wasn't leaving town, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell her you were not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't think I told her. But I had to be very&mdash;I would
lose my job if they thought I was leaving town. It was news to me.</p>

<p>So Lee that afternoon, from school, came into Kreeger's Specialty Shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
where I was working and said, "Mother. I want to join the Marines, and I have
quit school."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Kreeger&mdash;and he may be leaving&mdash;Mr. Frank Kreeger who is
owner of Kreeger's Specialty Shop, and all of the personnel there&mdash;this is a very
small shop, and Miss Lillian, who was manager, knows of this. I became very
excited and I started to cry. And they let me go home with Lee.</p>

<p>So Lee was determined at age 16&mdash;his birthday was going to be October 18th,
right&mdash;and this was October 7th&mdash;was going to join the Marines. So what Lee
wanted me to do was falsify his birth certificate, which I would not do. And
he kept after me, like a boy.</p>

<p>Now, this is a normal boy, wanting to join the Marines.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you don't just put that I am 17 years old."</p>

<p>I said, "Lee. We cannot do that."</p>

<p>He said, "Everybody else"&mdash;</p>

<p>I said, "No, I am not going to do it."</p>

<p>For 2 or 3 days Lee and I bickered back and forth about me falsifying his age.</p>

<p>So I have a very good friend, Mr. Clem Sehrt, who is an attorney in New
Orleans, La. I called him and told him I had a personal problem. I had not
seen Mr. Sehrt since early childhood. I knew the family. That Lee was not
of age and he wanted to join the Marines. And he quit the school and told
them we were going out of town.</p>

<p>He said, "Marguerite, I cannot advise you. It would be unethical. But a lot
of boys join the service at age 16."</p>

<p>So he could not advise me.</p>

<p>My sister, Mrs. Charles Murret, 757 French Street, knows of the complete
story. And so does my brother-in-law, Mr. Charles Murret, who also said, "Let
him join, let him go. If he wants to go so badly, let him join the Marines."</p>

<p>I, at that time, was living at 126 Exchange Place, which is the Vieux Carre
section of the French Quarter of New Orleans.</p>

<p>And, by the way, the papers said we lived over a saloon at that particular
address.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, if you have this information, that is just the French part of town.
It looks like the devil. Of course I didn't have a fabulous apartment. But
very wealthy people and very fine citizens live in that part of town, and there
are hotels and saloons, and courtyards where the homes are.</p>

<p>So I was very upset.</p>

<p>There was a colonel on the street that I stopped&mdash;I didn't know him&mdash;I said,
"Sir, I would like to talk with you." I told him about the boy wanting to join
the Marines and I didn't know what to do. I was frantic. And he was insistent
that I let him join the Marines at age 16.</p>

<p>So he advised me, "Well, if he doesn't want to go to school, let him join the
Marines. It is done all the time."</p>

<p>Now, I was not too happy about this situation.</p>

<p>Now, a recruiting officer from the Marine Reserve in New Orleans, La., was
in my home the next day when I arrived from work, with Lee, in uniform, in
the home when I got into the home. He introduced me to him and he said,
"Mrs. Oswald"&mdash;he didn't tell me what to do. He was very vague about the
thing.</p>

<p>I said, "No, Lee is too young, age 16, to join the Marines. They are liable
to send him overseas."</p>

<p>He said, "There is less delinquency in Japan and those places than we have
here."</p>

<p>He saw nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>What he was doing was telling me to falsify his birth certificate, but not in
plain words. He was telling me it would be all right for the boy to join the
Marines. He came to my home personally.</p>

<p>So I went to an attorney with Lee, because&mdash;here is the thing.</p>

<p>Lee's birth record is in New Orleans. And I knew that the Marine Corps
could easily check on this child, age 16&mdash;his birth record. So in order to have
a happy situation, so I could work, and to see Lee, I went to an attorney and
paid $5 and said that I lost Lee's birth certificate, and kind of motioned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
attorney. I knew it would not stand up. I bought Lee a duffle bag and everything,
and Lee went&mdash;we told him goodby, and Lee was going to join the Marines.</p>

<p>I had to accept that, gentlemen. There was no other way I could do, but accept
the fact to let him go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was that attorney?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Clem Sehrt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What did Mr. Sehrt allegedly tell you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What did Mr. Sehrt tell you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Sehrt is a family friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I know Mr. Sehrt very well.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said according to attorney ethics that he would not be able
to advise me. Before you came in, sir, I had stated that.</p>

<p>Now, when I get interrupted, I lose&mdash;this is a big thing for me. I am not
making excuses. But, gentlemen, it is awfully hard to do this.</p>

<p>So Lee came home. And he said the captain said that he was too young.</p>

<p>Now, I don't question much. I don't know whether Lee changed his mind,
or they sent Lee home. I do not know. I do not question that.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Lee, at age 16, read Robert's Marine manual back and forth. He knew it by
heart. Robert had just gotten out of the Marines, and his manual was home.
And Lee started to read communistic material along with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What communistic material did he read?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was a small book that he had gotten out of the library. And
I knew he was reading it, Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it in Marxism, or what was it about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;if you are saying the title is Marxism&mdash;no, sir, the title
was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it about communism?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was more about communism. I knew he was reading it.
But if we have this material in the public libraries, then certainly it is all
right for us to read. And I think we should know about these things, and all
of our scholars and educators and high school boys read subversive material,
which we call subversive material. So I, as a mother, would not take the book
away from him. That is fine. Lee is a reader. I have said from early childhood
he liked histories and maps.</p>

<p>So that is fine.</p>

<p>What I am saying now&mdash;we are getting to this agent part.</p>

<p>He is with this recruiting officer and he is studying the Marine manual&mdash;he
knew it back and forth. In fact, he would take the book and have me question
some of the things. And he was reading communism.</p>

<p>Lee lived for the time that he would become 17 years old to join the Marines&mdash;that
whole year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he do during that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he do during that year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What did he do during that year? He was working for&mdash;as a
messenger for Tujaque and Son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He had quite a few jobs, did he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I can explain that to you.</p>

<p>His first job was Tujaque and Son, who was steamship people, and he was a
messenger. And then he had a lot of friends.</p>

<p>Now, they say Lee didn't have friends. There were boys of his age&mdash;while
he was working he had an opportunity to make friends, coming to my home.
And one of the young men knew of a better paying job, where they had coffee
breaks and everything, so Lee took that job, which was with a dental laboratory&mdash;if
you have that information, sir.</p>

<p>And I think that is the only two jobs&mdash;no, Lee worked after school for Dolly
Shoe Co. I was working there, in charge of the hosiery department, and Lee
worked on Friday afternoon and Saturday as a shoe salesman.</p>

<p>That was his first job&mdash;while he went to school he worked there.</p>

<p>And then when he left school, as I told you, at age 16&mdash;the first job was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Tujaque and Company, steamship, and then the dental laboratory. And that
is the only jobs he had in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were there not times he didn't have any job during that year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;because when we left New Orleans, Lee left this dental
laboratory job&mdash;that is correct.</p>

<p>So I moved back to Fort Worth, Tex., because Robert did not want to live in
New Orleans. Robert was raised in Texas, and has his girl friends and all his
friends in Texas. So when Robert got out of the Marines, he wanted to live in
Texas. So I know that Lee wants to join the Marines at age 17, so in the
month of July 1956&mdash;and, gentlemen, I have always been broke, and I mean
broke. About a week before rent time, we had it pretty hard in order to have
that rent. Yet I take my furniture and ship it to New Orleans so Lee could be
with his brother and we could be with the family&mdash;thinking maybe with Robert
he would not join the Marines at age 17 and finish his schooling.</p>

<p>When Lee became age 17, October 18th, he joined the Marines.</p>

<p>The reason why he didn't go into the Marines until October 24th was the
recruiting officer at the Marines could not understand his birth certificate, because
his father had died 2 months before. So I had to send for an affidavit,
even though I had the death notice from the paper and everything, and they
could have&mdash;they could not understand that about that two months. I had to
send to New Orleans for an affidavit of his father's death.</p>

<p>And so then Lee joined the Marines on October 24th.</p>

<p>From the 18th to the 24th every day Lee was leaving. We even laughed
about it. Because he would leave in the morning and come home in the evening.
And it was because he was born 2 months before his father&mdash;so he did join the
Marines at age 18.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;that, Mr. Dulles, is the part you wanted to know. But, before, that has
something to do with it. <span class="locked">Lee&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Dulles wanted to know what you based this idea that he
was an agent on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is one part. That is the beginning of it, Mr. Dulles. I
have much more. That is the beginning of it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he join at 18 or 17?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He joined at age 17. I signed the paper. You will please forgive
me when I make mistakes, and if you will correct me.</p>

<p>Now, at age 15½ Lee was a member of the Civil Air Patrol.</p>

<p>Do you have that information, gentlemen?</p>

<p>I don't think you have.</p>

<p>Now, just a minute. I am sorry&mdash;this morning, when they were copying my
papers. I put this in my bag.</p>

<p>I have a picture right here&mdash;this is Lee at age 15½ in the uniform of the Civil
Air Patrol. This is before the recruiting officer. We are going back.</p>

<p>And this is what helped Lee to make up his mind to join the service.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Go right ahead, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At age 15½ or so, Lee joined the Civil Air Patrol. He went on
an airplane, on flights and everything. I got him the uniform, with Robert's
help. This young man&mdash;now, I do not know his name. He is from New Orleans.
And I am checking on these things. I have to do research on all of
this, and do it alone.</p>

<p>This young man and Lee were very friendly. The young man that gave Lee
the idea of&mdash;went to Beauregard School with him, and he and Lee joined the
Civil Air Patrol together. That is the way I wish to state this. And he often
came to the house. So there is a close friend of Lee. Lee is not supposed to
have any friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have any girl friends, too?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Now, neither did Robert or John Edward. No, sir.
Neither of my boys had girl friends until after about age 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have other close friends, boy friends, besides these that
you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I would not say he had&mdash;unless during working&mdash;he was
working at this time, and I was working during the day. But I mean at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
house this young man came to the house, and several of the other young men,
as I told you before.</p>

<p>Now, we are at the Civil Air Patrol.</p>

<p>And that is why Lee went to the Marine Corps, is because of the Civil Air
Patrol. He wasn't in the Civil Air Patrol long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, up to this point, you haven't told us anything that caused
you to think he was an agent, have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, maybe, sir, I am not doing a very good job of what I am
saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you think you have said that caused you to <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have said that a Marine recruiting officer came to my home,
and that Lee then continued reading Robert's manual by heart, and started
reading communist literature. He is preparing himself to go into the Marine
service&mdash;at age 17&mdash;this year before he actually joined the service. I am saying
he is already preparing himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. To become an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I think with the influence of this recruiting officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think the recruiting officer inspired <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, influenced this boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. &mdash;&mdash;to read the communist literature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;and Robert's Marine book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is there anything else you base that on, except what you have
told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About him being an agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, when I get through the whole story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I mean as far as the recruiting officer.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Otherwise than Lee's attitude. Lee read this manual. He
knew it by heart. I even said, "Boy, you are going to be a general, if you ever
get in the Marines."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you base the <span class="locked">idea&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had the idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He was being prepared to become an agent, and inspired by this
recruiting officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By what you have told us about his reading the communist
literature and this one pamphlet, and also the manual of the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And then living to when he is age 17 to join the
Marines, which I knew, and which he did at age 17 on his birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, what else do you base your idea that he was&mdash;ever became
an agent or was going to become an agent on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Many, many things. We always watched&mdash;it is "I Led Three
Lives"&mdash;the program&mdash;Philbrick. We always watched that. And when Lee
returned from the service and the Marines, the three days&mdash;that program was
on, and he turned it off. He said, "Mother, don't watch that, that is a lot of
propaganda."</p>

<p>It has been stated publicly that the FBI did not know&mdash;didn't have Lee on
the subversive list&mdash;I am probably not saying this right, gentlemen&mdash;but the
rightwing in Dallas. I don't know anything politically. The FBI and Secret
Service had a list of names in Dallas of people that had to be watched, and Lee
Harvey Oswald was not on that list. That would lead to believe there was some
reason he was not on the list.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who did you get that from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From the newspapers and all over. And there has been a lot
of comment about this all through.</p>

<p>Now, I don't say it is correct. But what I have explained to you before&mdash;my
way of thinking has to go with this, because I know the boy and the whole life,
and you do not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, I want to try to find out all you know about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fine. And I want you to.</p>

<p>Also, Lee's letters&mdash;and I have them in the hotel&mdash;I didn't bring them, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
I thought we were through, and you have the copies&mdash;most every letter from
Lee tells me something.</p>

<p>When Lee is coming back from Russia he says, "I plan to stop over in
Washington a while."</p>

<p>Lee says in the letter, "Marina's uncle is a major in the Soviet Union."</p>

<p>"I am an American citizen and I will never take Soviet citizenship."</p>

<p>If you will read every letter&mdash;if you think he is an agent&mdash;every letter is
telling his mother&mdash;"If something happens to me, Mother, these are facts."</p>

<p>I might be elaborating. But I think my son is an agent. And these things piece
by piece are going together, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you first think he was an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When Lee defected. And I have always said a so-called defection,
for this reason.</p>

<p>Now, we come to another letter. I am going to have to take some time now,
because we are not going in sequence. The letter Lee wrote to me from New
Orleans is what I need.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have the letter in which he says he was going to
Washington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I gave you that copy yesterday. I don't have the
letter with me. They are at the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You gave it to us yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;that he would stop over in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall the date of that one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, he was supposed to arrive in New York on the 13th
of June, 1962. And that is the letter. When he arrived, I do not know. And
I do not know if he went to Washington.</p>

<p>As I stated yesterday, he went to Robert's house, and I was on a case. So
I don't know when he arrived in New York.</p>

<p>Now, this is the letter. Lee is out of the Marines, and he stays home with me
3 days. And I have publicly stated&mdash;and this came out of my book this
morning&mdash;Lee came home September 14, 1959. He stayed 3 days with me. Said
he would like to travel on a ship working his way. Possibly export and import.
He remarked he could make more money that way.</p>

<p>The next page is the letter he sent me, and then came the news of his being
in Russia.</p>

<p>This is the letter.</p>

<p>"Dear Mother"&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that dated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. This is just dated September. He was released from
the Marine Corps on September 14th&mdash;I believe I am correct, Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>And he stayed with me 3 days.</p>

<p>And then this is&mdash;well, the date on the envelope is September 19th. He stayed
with me 3 days.</p>

<p>"Dear Mother, well, I have booked passage on a ship to Europe. I would have
had to sooner or later, and I think it is best to go now."</p>

<p>"I would have had to sooner or later, so I think it is best that I go now.
Just remember above all else that my values are very different from Robert
or us, and it is difficult to tell you how I feel. Just remember this is what I
must do. I did not tell you about my plans because you could hardly be expected
to understand. I did not see Lillian while I was here. I will write you again
as soon as I land. Lee."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you think he meant by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is what I want to tell you. All of this speculation,
gentlemen. And that is why I say the Warren Commission&mdash;unless they hear
my story and the witnesses involved, cannot arrive at a true conclusion.</p>

<p>Now, what would you think about this?</p>

<p>A few days later you get headlines. "Fort Worth Boy Has Defected to Russia."
And I made the letter public. This letter says to his mother he is defecting to
Russia&mdash;right? That is the way you would read the letter.</p>

<p>It is easily read this way when you think a boy has defected to Russia. So
you would read the letter that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles.</span> Mr. Rankin, do we have correspondence while he was in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you recall any letters you received from your
son during the time he was in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I have a special delivery letter. You see, gentlemen,
that is why I have tried to explain to you before&mdash;if I could have gone from the
story we would not all be so mixed up. This is a letter from the Marines
saying he is going to contact the Red Cross&mdash;when I told him about my illness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, that is the correspondence in regard to his getting out
of the Marines because of your need of his help and support.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, except for that correspondence, you don't have any other
correspondence from him while he was in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did have several letters.</p>

<p>What has happened, Mr. Rankin&mdash;when Lee stayed with me the 3 days, he left
his seabag with me. And that is why I have his discharge papers and things.
And then, as you know, when the defection broke, I had no place to go. So
the lady I was working for even threatened to call the police, because of the
defection. I was working for $5 a week, gentlemen, taking care of her son.
But I was happy to have a home and food, because I had had this accident, and
I could rest. But my salary was $5 for the whole week. But when the news
broke, she didn't want to be involved with anyone who had a son as a defector,
so she asked me to leave. It was a very cold winter night. And I said I would.</p>

<p>But I didn't want to leave&mdash;didn't have any place to go.</p>

<p>She said, "You will leave now or I will call the police."</p>

<p>So I called Robert and he told me to come out to his home.</p>

<p>When I went out to his home, I brought Lee's seabag, Mr. Rankin, with me.
And I stayed there just a short time. And Robert Oswald would not let me
have Lee's seabag. And there were a few letters in there from Lee in the
seabag.</p>

<p>And so I don't have the seabag.</p>

<p>You can read this letter, then, this way. That he is telling me he is defecting
to Russia.</p>

<p>We all agree there.</p>

<p>Then this same letter could be read the way I read it, as a mother.</p>

<p>After three days he is leaving his mother. But we had a talk. When Lee
arrived home&mdash;and I will go into this thoroughly. I was ashamed when he
arrived home. I was in a one bedroom and bath and a small kitchen. And
my son came in about 2 o'clock in the morning. I have never lived lavishly,
but we have always had a nice clean little moderate house. And, remember,
I was destitute. I had no money. You have the affidavits evidently from the
Red Cross. If you don't, I have copies.</p>

<p>The first thing I said to him, "Honey, the first thing we will have to do is to
move and find a decent place."</p>

<p>I had a studio couch, which has two parts. The top part I put on the floor for
my son to sleep on that particular night, in the one room.</p>

<p>So he said, "We will talk about it in the morning, Mother."</p>

<p>So morning came.</p>

<p>I brought the subject up immediately. I said, "The first thing we will have
to do is find a place. I am well enough that I can babysit or pick up a few
dollars. And until I settle my claim, I think we will be able to manage, and
you will get a job."</p>

<p>He said, "No, Mother, my mind is made up. I have thought this out thoroughly.
I have no background. If I stay here, I will get a job for about $35
a week, and we will both be in a position that you are in. I want to board a
ship and work in the import and export business, where there is some real
money."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He had quite a little money saved, didn't he, from the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will tell you about this&mdash;please, gentlemen, I will have to
break if you don't. This is a very, very serious life that I have gone through.</p>

<p>I didn't answer Lee.</p>

<p>This is the way I do the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> We will take a 10 minute recess now.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> The Commission will be in order. Mr. Rankin, you may
continue.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Rankin, you mentioned about the $1,600. Now. I don't know
if you know for a fact that Lee had $1,600. It was publicized in the paper that
he had $1,600, which is right here in 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he tell you anything about that at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he gave me $100. And he and his brother Robert had
arrived. And I am assuming it was over me because Robert did not help me.
And I have made that public in the Red Cross papers, that he had a family
of their own, that they probably thought their duty was to their family. I had
no help from the other two boys. And he gave me $100, and I stayed in this
little place a few weeks, and then I got the job for $5 a week. And that is Lee's
defection.</p>

<p>So here is my only contact with Lee in Russia, at the Metropole Hotel&mdash;this
is dated December 18, 1959.</p>

<p>Now, I have settled with the insurance company, and I have a little money.
So I sent a check to Lee for $20. And this is his little note. The only contact
I had with Lee from the time of his immediate defection until the State Department
2 years later informed me of my son's address. And this is his little note
that he needs money.</p>

<p>So I would say that Lee didn't have $1,600, according to this proof.</p>

<p>Now, we are speculating, as you will admit, because you thought the letter to
the school was from me. And you will have to admit that I have given you new
evidence. And so maybe Lee didn't have $1,600, because he is asking for money
there. That is when he is right in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Of course, that is quite a while later.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. He defected the end of November. This is December
1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had to make passage, and have some money. I don't know
if it took $1,600. I do not know, sir. But I am saying 5 weeks later he needs
money. We haven't gotten to this file yet.</p>

<p>I will quote from a newspaper, the Star Telegram, 1959, his defection, by
Mrs. Aline Mosby, who interviewed Lee in Moscow. It says here, "I saw my
mother always as a worker, always with less than we could use, he said. He
insisted his childhood was happy despite his poverty."</p>

<p>We had a very happy family. He insisted&mdash;this is the story in 1959. Lee had
a normal childhood.</p>

<p>And now he is criticizing the United States. He says, "Many things bothered
him in the United States. Race discrimination, harsh treatment of underdog,
Communists and hate." Then on the other letter he is going to Russia to write
a book. And there is another story and another story. And all kind of stories.
So what are we to believe, gentlemen. Is he throwing us off the track because
he is an agent. We are talking about speculation and newspaper papers, and
so on. And we know when he came back that he did go to Mrs. Bates, a Fort
Worth stenographer, and talked about the Soviet Union. She made it public.
And he only had $10. And he did not finish that story. And she said he was
very nervous. And he did not say he was an agent. But she got the impression
that he was an agent. This has been made public in the Star Telegram&mdash;if you
do not have that, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, is this the photostatic copy of the letter about his
booking passage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You read the original?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And this material on the bottom is just your own writing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This was in this book. That is my writing at the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The letter I was referring to is Exhibit 200.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it is this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 200.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 200 and received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, this one starting, "Dear Mother, received your letter,
and so forth"&mdash;that is the one about the Marines, when he was asking you
about getting out of the service and your need, and so forth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the letter which shows the different character of
the boy that the newspapers are making of him&mdash;when I wrote and told
him I had sold my furniture, and that my compensation and medical was
stopped, immediately my son sends a special delivery letter, and that is the
letter "received your letter, was very unhappy. I have contacted the Red
Cross, and they will contact you." This is a nice boy to do this immediately,
when he finds his mother is in trouble. He is not a louse, like
the papers have been making him out. He might have some bad points, but
so do all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We will ask the reporter to mark this.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 201 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 201 is the letter you are just referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 201.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 201 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then, Mrs. Oswald, the other one that you received from
Russia, with the check and the little note from your son Lee is the one
I am showing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you mark that as Exhibit 202?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 202 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 202 and ask leave to substitute
a copy.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 202 and
received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have followed up that request and sent the $20 bill in an
envelope. And I have all of this. But I am not going to go through all this
paper. You will have all of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did that get through&mdash;just as a matter of curiosity.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is what I am going to tell you. So I put a $20 bill
immediately in an envelope and sent it to Lee. And then after I thought
about it, I thought of a foreign money order. And gentlemen I have all this
in black and white for you, and this gentleman will copy and have
it&mdash;everything I am saying. So then I went to the bank and I got a foreign
money order for $25, and I sent it to Lee. It all went air mail. But it came
back about 2 months later, Mr. Dulles&mdash;the $20 bill I got back in cash
and the Chase National Bank foreign money order, that check came back in
cash. I will have that proof for you. I understand it comes back by boat,
and that is why it took so long.</p>

<p>So I had no way of knowing that my contact with my son was successful.
I didn't know until about 2 months later he had not received my
money. And by that time&mdash;well, I didn't know where he was, because I
came to Washington in January of 1961, had a conference with Mr. Boster&mdash;Mr.
<span class="locked">Stanfield&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think he was a Russian agent at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not think he was a Russian agent.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> I thought you answered in response to a question I
asked, when you thought he was an agent, you said when he defected.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I might have said defected to Russia. No, sir; I never
thought Lee was a Russian agent.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> I meant an agent of the United States. It is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
recollection that you said when he defected to the Soviet Union, you then
thought he was an American agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is right. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What else caused you to think he was an American agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right. I might be letting things out the way I am
going. And I am very unhappy about this. Had I started with his childhood
I could have worked up to age 15 very peacefully, and you would
have gotten everything. I hope I am not forgetting anything important. But
now we have letters from the State Department.</p>

<p>Well, my trip to Washington has to come before the letters to the State
Department, sir. So I am in conference with the three men. I showed
them the letter from the&mdash;the application from the Albert Schweitzer College,
and Lee's mail had been coming to my home. I didn't know whether he was
living or dead. I did not want to mail these papers. So I made a personal
trip to Washington.</p>

<p>I arrived at Washington 8 o'clock in the morning. I took a train, and
borrowed money on an insurance policy I have, which I have proof. I
had a bank account of $36, which I drew out and bought a pair of shoes.
I have all that in proof, sir, the date that I left for the train. I was 3
nights and 2 days on the train, or 2 days and 3 nights. Anyhow, I took a
coach and sat up.</p>

<p>I arrived at the station 8 o'clock in the morning and I called the White
House. A Negro man was on the switchboard, and he said the offices were
not open yet, they did not open until 9 o'clock. He asked if I would leave
my number. I asked to speak to the President. And he said the offices
were not open yet. I said, "Well, I have just arrived here from Fort Worth,
Tex., and I will call back at 9 o'clock."</p>

<p>So I called back at 9 o'clock. Everybody was just gracious to me over the
phone. Said that President Kennedy was in a conference, and they would be
happy to take any message. I asked to speak to Secretary Rusk, and they
connected me with that office. And his young lady said he was in a conference,
but anything she could do for me. I said, "Yes. I have come to town about a son
of mine who is lost in Russia. I do want to speak&mdash;I would like personally to
speak to Secretary Rusk." So she got off the line a few minutes. Whether she
gave him the message or what I do not know. She came back and said, "Mrs.
Oswald, Mr. Rusk"&mdash;so evidently she handed him a note&mdash;and Mr. Boster was on
the line&mdash;"that you talk to Mr. Boster, who is special officer in charge of Soviet
Union affairs"&mdash;if I am correct. And Mr. Boster was on the line. I told him
who I was. He said, "Yes, I am familiar with the case, Mrs. Oswald." He said,
"Will an 11 o'clock appointment be all right with you?" This is 9 o'clock in the
morning. So I said&mdash;this is quite an interesting story&mdash;I said, "Mr. Boster
that would be fine. But I would rather not talk with you." I didn't know
who Mr. Boster was. I said, "I would rather talk with Secretary of State Rusk.
However, if I am unsuccessful in talking with him, then I will keep my appointment
with you."</p>

<p>So I asked Mr. Boster&mdash;I said, "Mr. Boster, would you please recommend a
hotel that would be reasonable?" He said, "I don't know how reasonable, Mrs.
Oswald, but I recommend the Washington Hotel. It will be near the State Department
and convenient to you."</p>

<p>So I went to the Washington Hotel. And as we know, gentlemen, there were
nothing but men. They asked me if I had reservation. I said, "No, I didn't, but
Mr. Boster of the State Department recommended that I come here." So they
fixed me up with a room. I took a bath and dressed. I went to the appointment&mdash;because
this is 9:30, I am on the phone, and I had to take a cab to the
hotel. I arrived at Mr. Boster's office at 10:30.</p>

<p>But before arriving at Mr. Boster's office. I stopped at a telephone in the corridor,
and I called Dean Rusk's office again, because I didn't want to see Mr.
Boster, and I asked to speak to Dean Rusk. And the young lady said, "Mrs.
Oswald, talk to Mr. Boster. At least it is a start."</p>

<p>So then I entered around the corridor into Mr. Boster's office. I have all the
pictures of the State Department and everything to prove this story is true.
I told the young lady. "I am Mrs. Oswald. I have an 11 o'clock appointment."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Mr. Boster came out and said, "Mrs. Oswald, I am awfully glad you came early,
because we are going to have a terrible snow storm, and we have orders to leave
early in order to get home."</p>

<p>So he called Mr. Stanfield&mdash;the arrangements had been made&mdash;now, the other
man&mdash;I don't have that name here for you, Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is it Mr. Hickey?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Mr. Hickey. You are correct.</p>

<p>So then we were in conference. So I showed the papers, like I am showing
here. And I said, "Now, I know you are not going to answer me, gentlemen,
but I am under the impression that my son is an agent." "Do you mean a Russian
agent?" I said, "No, working for our Government, a U.S. agent. And I
want to say this: That if he is, I don't appreciate it too much, because I am
destitute, and just getting over a sickness," on that order.</p>

<p>I had the audacity to say that. I had gone through all of this without medical,
without money, without compensation. I am a desperate woman. So I said
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did they say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They did not answer that. I even said to them, "No, you won't
tell me." So I didn't expect them to answer that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Did you mean you were seeking money from them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I didn't think that my son should have gone&mdash;in a
foreign country, and me being alone. What I was saying was that I think my
son should be home with me, is really what I implied.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Did you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the words that I said before&mdash;I didn't come out and say I
want my son home. But I implied that if he was an agent, that I thought that
he needed to be home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything about believing that your son might know
full well what he was doing in trying to defect to the Soviet Union, he might like
it better there than he did here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not remember saying this. I know what I did say, and they
agreed with me. I said&mdash;because I remember this distinctly. I said, "Now,
he has been exploited all through the paper as a defector. If he is a defector"&mdash;because
as we stated before, I don't know he is an agent, sir&mdash;and if he is a
defector, that is his privilege, as an individual.</p>

<p>And they said, "Mrs. Oswald, we want you to know that we feel the same way
about it." That was their answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything about possibly he liked the Soviet way
of life better than ours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I may have. I do not remember, sir. Honestly. I may have
said that. I recall that they agreed with me, and they said, "We want him also
to do what he wants to do."</p>

<p>So now this is January 2, 1961, is my trip to Washington. Approximately 8
weeks later, on March 22, 1961&mdash;which is 8 weeks&mdash;I received a letter from the
State Department informing me of my son's address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall that they assured you there was no evidence he
was an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, there was no comment to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And they told you to dismiss any such ideas from your mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are sure they didn't tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am positive. I said to them, "Of course, I don't expect you
to answer me." No, sir, there was nothing mentioned about the agent at all.
And in fact, I would think, just as a layman, that the State Department would
not even consider discussing that with me. But I mean it was not discussed. I
am positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If they recorded in a memorandum as of that date that they
did say that to you, that would be incorrect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is incorrect, emphatically incorrect. That is incorrect.
Because I said, "I don't expect you to tell me. But if he is an agent," I didn't
think it was the thing to do.</p>

<p>Well, on January 21 was my trip to Washington, 1961. Approximately 8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
weeks later, on March 22, 1961, I received a letter from the State Department
informing me of my son's address, which you probably have, if you don't, sir, I
have the copies. And also stating that my son wishes to return back to the
United States&mdash;just 8 weeks after my trip to Washington.</p>

<p>Now, you want to know why I think my son is an agent. And I have been
telling you all along.</p>

<p>Here is a very important thing why my son was an agent. On March 22 I
receive a letter of his address and stating that my son wishes to return back
to the United States. You have that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On April 30, 1961, he marries a Russian girl&mdash;approximately 5
weeks later.</p>

<p>Now, why does a man who wants to come back to the United States, 5 weeks
later&mdash;here is the proof&mdash;April 30, 1961, is the wedding date&mdash;marry a Russian
girl? Because I say&mdash;and I may be wrong&mdash;the U.S. Embassy has ordered him
to marry this Russian girl. And a few weeks later, May 16, 1961, he is coming
home with the Russian girl. And as we know, he does get out of the Soviet Union
with the Russian girl, with money loaned to him by the U.S. Embassy. I may be
wrong, gentlemen, but two on two in my books makes four.</p>

<p>I have many more things that can go to this, and that has been published. I
will probably never know whether my son was an agent, because I do not expect
to be told these facts. But isn't it peculiar that a boy is coming home, and the
Embassy informs me of that&mdash;I have all this, Mr. Rankin, and you know I do.
You will have the copies. And then 5 weeks later he marries a Russian girl.
And the proof of it is that he does come home with the Russian girl in a short
length of time. And Lee would have been home 1 year earlier. But because of
the lack of money to come home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever ask him whether he married the Russian girl
because they ordered him to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I have never asked Lee any questions of that kind.
The only question I asked Lee was when they were living with me that 1 month,
I said, "Lee, I want to know one thing. Why is it you came back to the
United States when you had a job and you were married to a Russian girl,"
and they sent me lovely gifts and photographs and everything. So they seemed
to be well off.</p>

<p>I have a beautiful scarf&mdash;they sent tea, boxes of candy, which the postage is
terrific. He says, "not even Marina knows that." And that is the only question
I have ever asked my son. This may be hard to believe. But I have explained
to you over and over that I think we, as individuals, have a right to our
own life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You saw your daughter-in-law and your son living together with
you, didn't you, for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. They lived with me 1 month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think they were in love with each other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, they were definitely in love with each other. Yes, I think
they were in love with each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think at that time it was just because he was an agent
and ordered to marry her that he married her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. I would say this. This is purely speculation. He knew
Marina, and he loved Marina. They met at a dance. So that was&mdash;he had a
girl friend. We are saying if he is an agent&mdash;I have to say "if." Then he
tells the Embassy that he is in love with a Russian girl. And so it is a good
idea to bring the Russian girl to the United States. He will have contacts.</p>

<p>Now, when I was in Mrs. Paine's home, on the table was a lot of papers from
Lee. The Daily Worker I happen to know about. And many, many subversive&mdash;now,
I say if Lee is going to assassinate a President, or Lee is anything
that he is otherwise than an agent, Lee would not have all these things, he would
not have his finger in everything.</p>

<p>He would not be reading only communism and Marxism, that he would be a
fanatic about that one thing and have a cause to assassinate the President.</p>

<p>But that is not the picture of Lee Harvey Oswald. Lee has his hand in
everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by everything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, Cuba&mdash;because we know in New Orleans he was arrested
for Fair Play for Cuba. He read the Daily Worker. And the other ones I
don't know. But it was in the paper. There is plenty of subversive material.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about books? Did he read books much while he was living
with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he read continuously. He went immediately to the library
upon coming to the United States. He read continuously. All kinds of books.
I tried, when he defected&mdash;I went to the library to find out the kind of literature
that Lee read. But they could not give me that information. They said
the only way they could give that information was when a book was overdue,
and was out. But otherwise they have no record.</p>

<p>Now, it has been stated in the paper&mdash;maybe New Orleans is different, I don't
know, but I know in Fort Worth I could not get the information. Stated he had
books&mdash;the assassination of Huey Long and things of that sort. They must have
a different system. Because in Fort Worth, Tex., they do not have that system.
The only way they can tell is if a book is out. But I know Lee read.
And I have stated in 1959 all of this.</p>

<p>Anyway, from Vincent Peale on down to anything you want to mention. Lee
read continuously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, was there any time that Marina said anything to you to
lead you to believe that she thought your son, Lee, married her because he was
an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, no, sir. Not at any time at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think she loved him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that Marina loved him in a way. But I believe that
Marina wanted to come to America. I believe that Lee had talked America to
her, and she wanted to come to America. I say this for a lot of little things
that happened&mdash;that Marina wanted to come to America. Maybe she loved him.
I am sure she did, anyway. She said that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I am not clear about this being ordered to marry her. You
don't mean that your son didn't love her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I could mean that&mdash;if he is an agent, and he has a girl
friend, and it is to the benefit of the country that he marry this girl friend, and
the Embassy helped him get this Russian girl out of Russia&mdash;let's face it, well,
whether he loved her or not, he would take her to America, if that would give
him contact with Russians, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you don't think it was because your son loved her, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know whether my son loved her or not. But I am
telling you why he would do this&mdash;in 5-weeks time. Now, you have a 5-week
period in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I understand that. But I think it is a very serious thing to say
about your son, that he would do a thing like that to a girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it is not a serious thing. I know a little about the
CIA, and so on, the U-2, Powers, and things that have been made public. They
go through any extreme for their country. I do not think that would be serious
for him to marry a Russian girl and bring her here, so he would have contact.
I think that is all part of an agent's duty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think your son was capable of doing that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I think my son was an agent. I certainly do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you got anything more that caused you to think he was an
agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I have things that have been coming out in the paper.
And I am not the only one that thinks my son is an agent. There has been
many, many publications questioning whether Lee was an agent or not because
of circumstances, and so on, and so forth, through the newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is newspaper accounts you are talking about now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And as I said about the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about your own knowledge?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, that is why I wanted to go into the story. I wouldn't
have become emotionally upset had I started in sequence.</p>

<p>I told you about him not wanting me to see that program. And then the
letters. There is so much. About him being an agent&mdash;all of his correspondence
with the Embassy in Moscow. I have the letters in the hotel. One of
the letters states that the Russians cannot hold you&mdash;"the Russians cannot hold
you. You are an American citizen. You are not a bona fide Russian resident."
We have the letters. You have a copy of the letter, Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>And "if you will show this letter to the Russians, they cannot hold you in
Minsk."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They would say that about you if you were over there, or
anyone.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The point I am trying to bring there is Lee has always been an
American citizen&mdash;according to all of my papers from the State Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And they would say that about anyone&mdash;all right, I will grant
you that. You are probably right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So that doesn't prove he is an agent, that I can see.</p>

<p>Now, how do you feel it shows he was an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because he has the sanction of the American Embassy all
through this affair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They would give that to any of us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right&mdash;so you are telling me that. But this man is married
to a Russian girl, and does come back within a short time, and could have
come back sooner. It was the lack of money. And that is another thing.</p>

<p>The State Department repeatedly kept writing me, and I have the letters,
for the money. I have copies of my letters also. I could not raise the money.
I said I had a '54 Buick car, and all I could get a loan on was $250. They
wrote back and said could you ask some friends, or do you have any relatives&mdash;800
and some odd dollars they needed. And I went to 12 very prominent people
in Vernon, Tex.&mdash;one who is a very respected citizen that they recommended
me to go, who has a citizen award. And I felt very confident maybe he would
help me. I told him that my son, who was a very young man, who was an
American citizen, is trying to get back to the United States, but there is lack of
money, and if he knew of any way possible he could help me.</p>

<p>He said "You mean he is a defector?" I said, "Possibly so. The paper has
said he was a defector." And he said, "Well, I am sorry, Mrs. Oswald, but
these boys that are in the service and defect, I don't have any use for."</p>

<p>And I said, "Do you go to church, sir?" He said, "Yes, I do." And I said,
"Probably you go to church to put your hat on. Because here is a boy. Let's
say he has made a mistake. He has gone to Russia. But let's say he realizes
now he has made a mistake, and he wants to come back. Are you telling me
you won't help him?"</p>

<p>"That is what I am telling you, Mrs. Oswald. I don't have any use for
anybody." Which Senator Tower said that he would not help Lee&mdash;made it
public. These are nice people saying this. I say the ones who are down
and out are the ones that need the help. This boy was a young boy. Let's
say he is not an agent. Let's say he defected to Russia. Yet he wants to
come back. He deserved a helping hand. I went to 12 people. I did not beg.
But I presented my case. And not a one offered to help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Didn't you understand that the State Department had to try
to find out if they could&mdash;or you or your son could get the money from other
sources before they could advance the money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I understand that. I am trying to tell you that I
tried awfully hard, but with no success.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So they were just trying to do their duty in that regard, were
they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It could be, yes. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't think that makes him an agent, just because they
asked <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think&mdash;well, as you say, they would probably help anyone.
And then again, because he is married to a Russian girl, and because all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
documents and everything are handled through the U.S. Embassy. And because
of my trip to Washington&mdash;which was red carpet treatment. Let's say,
gentlemen, if a woman gets on the phone at 9 o'clock and has an appointment
at 11 o'clock with three big men, that is wonderful treatment.</p>

<p>Now, they probably would do that to anybody. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They might have done <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I haven't been that fortunate before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well, that shouldn't be held against them that they treated
you nicely.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I have told you, Mr. Rankin, they were most gracious to
me. The Administration was most gracious to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I don't see why you should think that because they treated
you nicely, that was any sign he was an agent.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, maybe you don't see why. But this is my son. And
this is the way I think, because I happen to know all of the other things that
you don't know&mdash;the life and everything. I happen to think this. And this
is my privilege to think this way. And I can almost back it up with these
things.</p>

<p>This is a stranger to you folks. But this is a boy I have known from a child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How much money do you think, he received for being an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have no idea?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But I do know this, and I have stated this. I have approximately
900 and some odd dollars. And I lost my job. That can be proven. I
was a nurse on the 3 to 11 shift, working in a rest home, for a very wealthy
woman. And it would have been at least a year, a year and a half case. She
is not that bad off. She is just an invalid. She is going to live quite a while.</p>

<p>When I returned home from the Six Flags on Thanksgiving Day, the Deputy
Sheriff at Fort Worth, Tex. went to get my pay. And the nurse, the 7 to 3:30
o'clock nurse&mdash;I went 3 to 11&mdash;and my patient cried and said that they were
awfully sorry, but they could not have me back on the case. That the woman
at the rest home refused to have me.</p>

<p>Now, I was not working for the rest home. I was doing private duty. But
I understand that this is her place of business, and my presence there might
have been&mdash;hurt her money part. But this is our Christian way of life. The
boy was accused of killing the President, with no proof. And then the mother
loses her job.</p>

<p>Now, that is my position. You asked me the question. But Marina has
$35,000 publicly. What she has, I do not know.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, $35,000 is a lot of money in donation dribs and drabs&mdash;is
a very large sum of money. I question where does that money come from.
Yes, some of it could be coming from Lee's back pay. And she might have more
than that. That was the amount made public&mdash;$35,000. And here is a mother
without a job. And everybody knows I have no money. And my contributions
are 900 and some odd dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, when you say that money that Marina has might come
from your son's back pay, what do you base that on? Just speculation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am basing all of this on speculation. Sir, if I had proof,
I would not be taking my energy and my emotional capacity to bring all this
out&mdash;if I had proof he was an agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When they asked you to contribute some money to help bring
him home from Russia, did it occur to you that if he is an agent the government
could just pay his way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. But they don't want the public to know he is an agent.
They want me to have all of this. They don't want the public to know. I am
going around to people&mdash;you brought up a very good point. I am going around
trying to get money for this boy to come home, so the public knows. Sure,
they could have given him the money to come home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you trying to get money now? I don't understand what
you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think, Mr. Rankin, you asked me the question that if he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
an agent, that the Government would have given him the money to come home
without any trouble. I say just the opposite. That it was a very good point.
If he was an agent, it would make it hard for him to get the money to come
home.</p>

<p>Remember, I am under the impression he is coming home with this Russian
girl in order to continue his work. So he cannot be given the money immediately
to come home, because his mother might tell the story to someone. Lee was
almost a year coming home for lack of money. So then they have an excuse
to loan him the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever learn that he was getting money from the Red
Cross in addition to his pay&mdash;that is the Russian or Soviet Red Cross, when
he was over there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know what he did with that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know anything about that. The Red Cross from here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. The Soviet Red Cross.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I know nothing about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You didn't know he was supposed to have gotten an amount
equal to the pay he received from his job. He got that from the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't follow you. I do not know. I don't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He got so much a month from his job in the electronics factory.
You understood that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was not in an electronics factory. I thought he was working
in a radio factory. All right, fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then he got an equal amount, we understand, from the
Red Cross of the Soviet Union. Did you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. Now, explain to me&mdash;when you say the Red Cross
of the Soviet Union. Is that our American Red Cross in the Soviet Union,
or this is part of the Russian Red Cross?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is part of the Russian Red Cross.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It is not any part of the American Red Cross.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I do not know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Their Red Cross is somewhat different than ours, I understand,
because the Government has so much to do with activity there that the Red
Cross is closely associated with the Government itself, while in this country,
as you know, it is generally supported by the public.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I did not know that.</p>

<p>Now, one other thing pertaining to this. When Marina and Lee returned
from Russia, and they were at my daughter-in-law's home, Robert's home, and
I came in from the job in the country to see them, I said&mdash;up until this time,
gentlemen, I thought Russians were peasant-looking people, like the public.
And I said, "Lee, she doesn't look Russian at all. She looks American." He
said, "Of course, mother, that is why I married her, is because she looks American."
In front of my daughter-in-law and Robert. He bragged that she looked
like an American girl. And there is all little things of that sort.</p>

<p>As I say, I cannot remember everything in my life, because I am going&mdash;this
is way back&mdash;in a few hours time, Mr. Rankin. But there is many, many things
that come up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How does that show that he was an agent at that time. I don't
understand that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't either. But I am telling you the expressions. He is
making a point. And what I was going to make a point&mdash;Lee loved his work, and
Lee loved the Marines. Lee loved the Marines, Mr. Rankin. Even coming back&mdash;he
was a military man. And that has also been stated in the paper, that he had
a military manner about him. I think District Attorney Wade remarked something
of that order. People have noticed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What made you think he loved the Marines? Was there
something he did when he came back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He loved the Marines because his brother was a Marine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
for one thing. And John Edward&mdash;that is his career&mdash;14 years. My brother was
in the Navy. His father was a veteran. We are a servicemen family. And I
know Lee loved the Marines. I told you how he read the manual before he left.
And on leaves, coming home, Lee would brag. He even said when he came home
from Japan, "mother, my stay in Japan, just the trip alone would have cost
about $2,000."</p>

<p>Now, Lee, I know also, was in the Air Force of the Marines, and he went to
Biloxi, Miss., for schooling. Lee has had quite a bit of schooling. And Lee spoke
Russian equivalent to 1 year when he defected to Russia. I have that on his
application from the Albert Schweitzer College. And Lee spoke and wrote
Russian fluently when he went to Russia. So Lee learns Russian in the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he ever talk about reenlisting into the Marines after he
returned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, when Lee returned he was with me 3 days, and then, of
course, he went over to visit Robert's house. So actually we didn't talk. I was
trying to find a home. And I didn't think he would go. I was hoping that Lee
would not go on the ship and work. I was hoping he would stay home. We
were interrupted before. When he said to me about, that he wanted to work
on a ship in the import and export business, I started to tell you I agreed with
him. And this is how you have to do&mdash;particularly when you are a woman.
A father could tell the man, "You are not going to do this." But I went along
with that. And then the next day I said, "Lee, why don't you stay," and I
went into that&mdash;"until I settle my claim, and I can babysit and we can get
along." He said, "No, my mind is made up. If I stay, we will both be in these
circumstances." So on the third day&mdash;I knew he wanted to do this, but I
didn't think he was going to do it for a month or two. But on the third day
he came with his suitcase in the room and he said, "Mother, I am off." So
since his mind was made up, I told him goodby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He said nothing about reenlisting in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, the three days he was home. That was the conversation,
about him going on a ship. I saw his passport. And his passport was stamped
"import and export" on his passport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did it say anything about Soviet Russia on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. What I am saying is that I saw the passport with big
writing "export and import." I think it was blue. I did not read the passport,
because Lee was there, but I happened to see the passport, "export and import"
stamped.</p>

<p>Whether he had another passport, I do not know. I didn't ask. I am saying
this&mdash;and God knows I am telling you the truth. I am just this type person.
It is because of my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know that he spoke Russian at that time, when he had
this passport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not know. The only time I knew that he spoke
Russian is what came out in the news. But when I really knew was Lee's
application for the Albert Schweitzer College. Shall we go into that&mdash;the
application?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, the first that I knew&mdash;no, I am wrong. It is not the
first I knew. I had received a letter from Lee while in the Marines before
he knew of my trouble, stating that he was accepted by the Albert Schweitzer
College. And that letter was in the sea bag that I told you about, that I do
not have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you give us the date of that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The other letter would have been&mdash;let's see. Lee was told in
July about my trouble. And the other letter I would say would be about May
or June. This is March 22. I received this in care of Lee. And you see, sir,
I have a lot of addresses, because I am now living in these homes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. '57 or '58?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1960.</p>

<p>Let's see now.    Then I heard from the State Department in 1961.</p>

<p>"Due to a number of circumstances, we found ourselves forced to make a
slight change in the arrival and departure dates of the third term. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
lecture will be held on Tuesday afternoon 16.00 o'clock, April 19, instead of taking
place on the 21st with the arrival day on the 20th. It will mean that the
students arrive either on the evening of Monday, the 18th, or before noon on
April 19th. This change, however, makes it possible to end the term on the
weekend of July 2. We hope that you will still be able to fit this change of
dates into your travel plan. Should it not be possible for you to arrive on
the earlier date we, of course, understand the difficulty. In the latter case,
please drop us a line."</p>

<p>So that is how I knew that Lee&mdash;I opened his mail. I didn't know whether
my son was living or dead, sir. And that is how I knew&mdash;I won't go into all this.
He made a deposit. I have all of this for you.</p>

<p>He made a deposit. And this is my copies to them.</p>

<p>Now, one thing I have forgotten.</p>

<p>While at the State Department, the State Department told me that Lee had
gone to Finland before Russia. And I did not know that.</p>

<p>Now, Lee had applied at a college in Finland, evidently, because on the application
it states such a fact. I did not know, because the paper just said he
arrived in Russia&mdash;until I went to the State Department.</p>

<p>So what I am trying to say&mdash;I may be forgetting a lot of important things,
because I am just now remembering what the State Department told me.</p>

<p>I don't think I am forgetting too much.</p>

<p>But, after all, I am going through a whole life, and it is very hard.</p>

<p>This is Lee's original application, that you cannot possibly have had. This
is the only application there is. So this is something new for you gentlemen.
I am not going to go through it all, because you have a copy. But I am going
to show you the thinking of this young man.</p>

<p>"Special interests: Religious, vocational, literary, sports, and hobbies.
Philosophy, psychology, ideology, football, baseball, tennis, stamp collecting"&mdash;Lee
had a stamp collecting book. "Nature of private reading: Jack London,
Darwin, Norman Vincent Peale, scientific books, philosophy, and so on."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> That is an application to where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is an original application for the Albert Schweitzer School.</p>

<p>"Active part taken in organizations. Student body movement in school for
control of juvenile delinquency, member YMCA, and AYA association."</p>

<p>I don't know what that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did you get this copy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had contacted Congressman Jim Wright, that has helped
me&mdash;helped me to locate Lee through the State Department. But Mr. Jim
Wright was not successful.</p>

<p>I was successful because of my trip to Washington, as you know.</p>

<p>And from the trip to Washington, I went to the building where Mr. Jim Wright
worked, and I went in to tell the secretary about the trip to Washington. And
that I had heard from Lee.</p>

<p>Well, I had information here that Lee had paid a deposit. So I had written
the school and asked if we were entitled to the return of the deposit, since he
didn't show up. But I did not get an answer.</p>

<p>So Mr. Wright's secretary said that, "Mrs. Oswald, I will write and see what
we can do."</p>

<p>So she wrote, and then they sent the application and everything back to
Jim Wright's office. And that is how I got the application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. They may be interested in knowing where the college is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is in Switzerland. Albert Schweitzer College, Chur Walden,
Graubuenen, Switzerland. "Application Form. High School. Completed high
school by correspondence."</p>

<p>I have that. His original correspondence in the service&mdash;completed high
school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that part of his Marine work&mdash;he finished high school that
way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"January '58, Passing 65 on scale of 100 B plus. College: None."</p>

<p>And then I read his books.</p>

<p>Now, we go down to here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
"Vocational Interests if decided upon: To be a short story writer on contemporary
American life."</p>

<p>Now, "General statement regarding reasons for wishing to attend the Albert
Schweitzer College: In order to acquire a fuller understanding of that subject
which interests me most, philosophy, to meet with Europeans who can broaden
my scope of understanding, to receive formal education by institutes of high
standing and character, to broaden my knowledge of German, and to live in a
healthy climate and good moral atmosphere."</p>

<p>This is very good thinking, gentlemen. We are getting a picture now of the
boy which has been not told in the paper.</p>

<p>I have read this one particular statement at three press conferences. The
first press conference was about 80 members there, from foreign lands and
everything. Nothing was printed. Then I had a second press conference with
16 men and I said, "Now, I am tired of the things that are being said about my
family, myself, and Lee. We are not perfect. But I know there is some good
things. And I have read a particular statement that has not been printed.
Let's see if one of you has the courage to print it."</p>

<p>There was 16 there. That did not come out. I had a third conference, and
I said the same thing and quoted this. That was not made public in the paper.</p>

<p>I hold a lot of these answers, gentlemen, as you know by now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You notice the next paragraph, about his plans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, "Plans to be pursued after the period at Albert Schweitzer
College: To attend the short summer course of the University of Turku, Turku,
Finland."</p>

<p>Now, I have a brochure. This I cannot understand&mdash;from this college, dated
1960. I have this for you, Mr. Rankin&mdash;dated 1960.</p>

<p>Lee is in Russia.</p>

<p>And the men in the State Department told me he went to Finland before
Russia. But this is dated 1960. I have it for you.</p>

<p>But I don't understand that.</p>

<p>"Then to return to America and pursue my chosen vocation."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I want to ask you about that. Do you think he meant this at
the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know. I am saying&mdash;and I am going to stick to my
story&mdash;that Lee is an agent, then a lot of this is a lot of baloney. I cannot make
it any stronger. I don't know, sir. The boy is gone, and I didn't hear from
his own lips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that he decided to defect after this application, then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know, sir, because I have not had this from the boy.
I am speculating. But I have a lot of documents to sustain my speculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, this, you cannot tell one way or another about whether
he is an agent by this.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I cannot tell by anything he is an agent, if you want proof.
I am becoming a little discouraged about this, because I keep telling you&mdash;I did
not have proof, sir. But I am giving you documents leading to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All I am trying to find out is what you have. You are giving
us that. I am also trying to find out whatever proof you have about these
various things that we can rely on.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I am going to state once and for all, because it upsets me
very much emotionally. And I have stated before, I do not have proof, sir.
I do not have proof of an agent. I do not have proof my son is innocent. I do
not have proof.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't have any proof of a conspiracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of anything. It is just as I feel, like the Dallas police do not
have proof my son shot President Kennedy. If they have anything, it is circumstantial
evidence. I have as much circumstantial evidence here that Lee was
an agent as the Dallas police have that he shot President Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Familiarity with foreign languages, if any. Russian equal in fluency to
about 1 year's education or schooling. I also speak a very little German. General
condition of health: Good. Have you ever had any serious illness or
nervous disturbances: No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> That is correct.</p>

<p>I want to get to that psychiatric. There will be a story there.</p>

<p>"Does such a condition still exist: No."</p>

<p>I don't understand this&mdash;do you?</p>

<p>"General condition of health: Good. Have you had a serious illness or
nervous disturbance, no. If so, explain."</p>

<p>Then he has a dash.</p>

<p>"Are you at present receiving medical or psychiatric care? No."</p>

<p>And then he gives as references&mdash;you have this, so I won't go into it.</p>

<p>A chaplain&mdash;would you like me to go into all these names for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No, we can offer this.</p>

<p>Did you know any of those people that he showed as references?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I do not. And that is dated the 3d, 4th, '59. And this
is another application form from the Albert Schweitzer College.</p>

<p>"I hereby apply to attend the student course from April 12, 1960 to June 27,
1960. Surname: Oswald. Christian name: Lee Harvey. Mr. Age, 20.
Mother tongue: English. Other language you know: Russian. Equal in fluency
to 1 year of schooling. Occupation: Student. Nationality: American. Exact
address: MCAF, MACS-9, Santa Ana, California, USA. Remarks: Please inform
me of the amount of the deposit if required so I can forward it and
confirm my reservation and show my sincerity of purpose. Thank you. Lee
Harvey Oswald."</p>

<p>Well, he did, and I have this here, make a deposit of $25, which the school
informed me that they would not be able to refund, because it would take care
of any incidentals that had occurred for him not appearing.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, it is 10 minutes to five, I believe I had a full day. I worked last
night on the papers. I came early to have copies made.</p>

<p>This was a complete story, I believe, and I have at least three other complete
stories. And I have a story of my life that I believe from newspaper accounts
that you will be very surprised also to know the type person I am. But according
to the newspaper&mdash;of course, really nothing bad has been said about me, otherwise
than one particular instance. That I can prove and have witnesses that it
is not the case.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Mrs. Oswald, you said you had three more stories. Just
name them. Name what stories they are, so we will know what they are.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>It would be Lee's life, sir, from early childhood, and the psychiatric treatment
in New York, that I want to tell you about.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Up to 16?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, because we have finished that, because we went into
that.</p>

<p>And then my life, from early childhood, which you have asked, Mr. Rankin,
in a letter.</p>

<p>The third was Lee as an agent, which I have gone into.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Lee what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee being an agent.</p>

<p>But I have really gone into that.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> So really, there are only two more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, my life and Lee's life.</p>

<p>Now, I would like you to have this picture&mdash;if you have not seen it. And I
will not comment on it. I want you to study it thoroughly, use a magnifying
glass, if possible, and if you care to, we will discuss it.</p>

<p>Now, this is out of the Post Magazine.</p>

<p>There is another picture that I would like the Commission to get which, is in
the Memorial Issue of President Kennedy&mdash;I think it is the Post. I will get
that information for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Would you like to advise the Commission generally what you
believe they will find out from this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would rather not comment on that at this particular moment.
I submit it to them for them to look over all the people, to study it. I have two.
You may have that one for the record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles.</span> What does this purport to be of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a picture of the book depository the day of the assassination
of President Kennedy. And there are people in the picture.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Well, is there anything you want us to see in the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I would rather you see it yourself. I see what I see.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> What do you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, all right.</p>

<p>I see Marina and the child&mdash;the girl and the baby, it could be Marina.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Will you show us, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And, again, I am saying&mdash;I cannot be sure this is the picture.
But this right here. This girl with this baby could possibly be Marina and June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And that is the <span class="locked">girl&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This girl holding the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Right next to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, right next to the door. In back of her is the hat of
a man. I have started this. I will continue.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 203, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I offer this?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibit 203.</p>

<p>And that is the photograph that you were just referring to, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is the photograph the day of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you pointed out the girl on the left <span class="locked">column&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of the entrance to the book depository, holding a child.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit No.
203 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do we know the time this was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell about the time this was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This, I understand, was when President Kennedy was shot.
He is supposed to be holding his throat here. And this is the car. This is right
after he passed the book depository, when he is supposed to have been shot.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Very well.   We will adjourn until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4:55 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARGUERITE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10 a.m. on February 12, 1964, at 200
Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; Representative Hale
Boggs and Representative Gerald R. Ford, members.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant
counsel; and John F. Doyle, attorney for Mrs. Marguerite Oswald.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> The Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>We will proceed to the hearing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Mrs. Oswald, did you have anything you wanted to say
to us this morning before we start the questioning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I meant to yesterday morning. I have two or three things
that are worrying me.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin, on Monday, when I testified that I had not been questioned
officially, you told me that I had. And if I remember correctly, sir, you said
that there was 28 pages of testimony, or was it 8 pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Twenty-eight, I think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Well, Mr. Doyle, as my attorney&mdash;I am very concerned about
that, because I want to know&mdash;if it is my testimony&mdash;because the little while&mdash;the
testimony that I gave to the FBI when I entered the courthouse was
approximately about 10 minutes. They immediately left to investigate. They
did not talk to me again, sir.</p>

<p>And then the only other testimony that I gave on tape was the starting of
Lee's defection at the Six Flags Inn, which I would say ran approximately 10
or 15 minutes. And that is the only time I have testified.</p>

<p>Now, if you have all this other testimony from me, I don't think it is fair,
because I should know what I am supposed to have said. I need to know what
I am supposed to have said.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Mrs. Oswald, whatever we have that we are told you have
said, you and your attorney are entitled to see, and I will see that you can.
We won't delay the proceeding this morning. But you may see it before you
leave the building.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes&mdash;it is very important to know that.</p>

<p>Thank you, Justice Warren.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, on that point, will it be satisfactory if we
furnish a clean photostatic copy to Mr. Doyle?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes, that will be satisfactory. You may do that, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I certainly need to know what I am supposed to have said.</p>

<p>There is an FBI agent by the name of Mr. John Fain. I will ask you, Mr.
Rankin, if you have his address, or do you know about Mr. John Fain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I know of Mr. John Fain as one of the agents that had some
interviews with your son.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, Mr. John Fain is the agent that I called upon myself
after Lee's defection. I read where the Secret Service were investigating the
family background, and I mistook it for the FBI. So I called the FBI and he
came to my home. And he is the agent who recommended me to talk to Jim
Wright and Sam Rayburn as a friend, and to write the letters.</p>

<p>Now, the one point I am going to bring out is this. When Lee returned from
Russia and was at Robert's home, Mr. Fain&mdash;in the meantime he had come over
to Robert and talked to him several times, and to me, supposedly as a friend&mdash;he
said he was not on the case. I do not know this. But he came to Robert's
home and said to Lee&mdash;my daughter-in-law is a witness there&mdash;"Lee, I am
not on the case, but I would like you voluntarily to come to the office at your
convenience and tell me your story, because I am interested in your case. Your
mother was the one who contacted me. And I have been to see Robert. And I am
quite interested in a young boy going to Russia. And you must have a story."</p>

<p>So Lee voluntarily went with Mr. Fain to the FBI office.</p>

<p>Then when Lee returned, his remark was "Well, he didn't believe me. He
wanted me to take a lie detector test, which I refused."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. John Fain may have the story we are looking for, you see&mdash;because
Lee went and gave the story.</p>

<p>And I want to make sure you know where he is now.</p>

<p>I have information from Senator Mike Monroney that in March&mdash;I am ahead
of my story.</p>

<p>The FBI agents now in Fort Worth have told me they do not know Mr. John
Fain. I said I happen to know that is his name.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Oswald, I worked in this office 9 years, and there has never been
such a person as Mr. John Fain."</p>

<p>So I have investigated. And Senator Mike Monroney gave this information.
He did work in the Fort Worth office from March 1949 to October 1962, and
then he retired in January 15, 1963. He is not a man to retire as far as age,
as far as I am concerned. I don't think Mr. John Fain is that old.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> We will check that out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have his last address in Houston, if you don't have it.</p>

<p>All right. Fine.</p>

<p>Now, one thing about Lee being an agent I read.</p>

<p>The neighbors that were interviewed in Fort Worth, Tex., by the FBI&mdash;this
is from newspaper accounts&mdash;said that Lee always walked a few feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
front of his wife when they went walking, and they wondered about that,
because it was very strange that he should walk ahead. I am speculating
maybe, but maybe there is a reason that Lee would walk ahead to protect his
wife.</p>

<p>That is my reasoning&mdash;as an agent.</p>

<p>The letter that is missing&mdash;and Mr. Doyle can verify this&mdash;the first letter
to Lee is missing, that Lee wrote to me, rather, from Russia. And this letter
stated&mdash;and it seemed to me, Mr. Rankin, I have seen it in one of the magazines&mdash;as
I have stated I have sold several of Lee's letters. And maybe in the rush
the letter got lost or stolen, I don't know.</p>

<p>But his first letter, he told me not to send him any money.</p>

<p>"I repeat, do not send any money as it is not necessary for you to pay me
back. You could send reading matter. I am lonesome to read. Also, send a
can of Rise Shaving Cream, a Gillette Razor," and there was a book he wanted
to read, I believe it was 1984.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What date was this you sent that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is a letter Lee sent to me that is missing&mdash;the first letter
that Lee sent to me. And why I sent the money&mdash;because I had used his
income tax return, which was $33, because Lee was lost&mdash;and I was destitute, and
I knew Lee would never prosecute his mother for using his money, because
Lee would help me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean that was a refund.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A refund. And I got the refund and used it, sir. And I also
used Lee's first check that came from the Marines. And I had no way of
knowing where Lee was. And I used it. And so I offered to pay Lee back.
And this letter has been printed. I have seen it. But I do not have it. So
that is very important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. As you had mentioned, you and I went through the papers that
you had brought with you from your home in Texas to Washington, and we
did not find such a letter among those papers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right. I have those letters laminated, and I didn't
give a list, and if it was taken I don't know what became of the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Liebeler said he had seen references to the letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. References. And I am sure it was probably one of the letters
I had sold, as I told you.</p>

<p>Yes, sir, you are correct there.</p>

<p>Now, there is another thing that we have skipped.</p>

<p>While in Dallas 2 weeks ago I had a press conference, and I called Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall
Inc., 522 Browder, in Dallas.</p>

<p>Now, this is a printing shop, where Lee worked.</p>

<p>Now, this is another thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was the photoengraving place that you talked about,
wasn't it, in your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Photoengraving place. I talked to Mr. Stovall. Now, Lee was
employed there, he informs me, from October 12th to April 6th, and I asked
him about the young couple coming to the house, if he was the father of the
girl, or if he knew of a couple who had a Russian&mdash;the girl had a Russian
father, the grandfather, as I testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he said, no. And he didn't know about that. He said&mdash;this
is the part&mdash;that Lee had worked at a place prior to his place. That is
not so, and I can prove it. I was on an OB case for Mrs. Rosenthal. We will
have to get a 1962 calendar. October 12th, or thereabouts, is when I was released
from this OB case. And this was the Sunday that I asked to get off
an hour or two, and went to Lee's house, and saw this couple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. October 12th was a Friday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Was a Friday. All right.</p>

<p>Now, so, let's see where I am.</p>

<p>This woman would not give me the information, of her last check to me.
I tried and tried, and told her how important it was. It was a Friday. So
then it would have to be, then, Mr. Rankin, the week before&mdash;the Sunday of
the week before then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> That would be October 7, 1962.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am still going to try to investigate this thoroughly, because
it is very important.</p>

<p>He claimed that Lee worked another place first.</p>

<p>Now, do you know if <span class="locked">Lee&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Let's don't&mdash;we will go into those things.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But if you don't know, Chief Justice Warren, how will you go
into it?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Please don't turn this into examining the Commission. We
will go into those things very thoroughly.</p>

<p>Just go ahead with your story.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, this is a lie, and I want to know about this lie.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> All right, you have told us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have not finished, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Well, you may go ahead and tell what you want. But don't
question the Commission. That is the only thing I am asking you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I don't know about questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. I think if you compose yourself, if you would, and just go ahead
and give the Commission all the information you have.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>.. Well, that is what I think I am doing. If I am doing it a
wrong way, you will have to understand. I am a layman. I am the mother
of this accused boy. I understand that is what the Commission is for, to get
all information possible to come to a conclusion.</p>

<p>And if I have found out that my date of employment is the date that Lee was
employed in Dallas, and this man said he worked some place before, I think
that is very important information.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> We will check on that.</p>

<p>Go right ahead with your own story.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Maybe I should apologize for taking up so much of the Commission's
time, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Go right ahead with the business, and when you give the Commission
the facts, then the Commission will take on from there in their own
judgment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>.. Mr. Doyle, while she is taking a moment, I will hand you a
photostatic copy of this tape recording of an interview with Mrs. Marguerite
Oswald&mdash;it purports to be that&mdash;recorded on November 25, 1963, an interview
by J.&nbsp;M. Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>.. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, one thing we have not covered was Lee's discharge.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> May I interrupt just a minute?</p>

<p>Is that the document we were talking about just a little while ago, a copy
of which was to be given to Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is right, that is the one requested.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> And the one you were speaking <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As a 28-page document.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes&mdash;all right.</p>

<p>Now, you may continue, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>This is Lee's questionable, dishonorable discharge, where I come in.</p>

<p>The first envelope was addressed to Lee Harvey Oswald, airmail. And Lee
was in Russia, as we know. We have the proof. And you have all of the copies
of this, I am sure.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And this you do not have. You have a copy now, but you do
not have the story, Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>It states that the discharge by reason of unfitness, recommendation for discharge,
reason of unfitness.</p>

<p>Well. I wrote to the U.S. Marine Corps&mdash;now, where is the copy of my letter?</p>

<p>I talked to a commandant at the Marine Corps and read this to him. And he
advised me how to write to the Marine Corps, the official of the Marine Corps.
And that is a copy of the letter.</p>

<p>I asked&mdash;well, he will get me the letter, I am sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
So then I will read the answer to my letter.</p>

<p>Is that satisfactory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes. Mr. Liebeler is going to get the copy that he has.</p>

<p>Now, can you tell the Commission when you first learned about this matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It would be on the envelope, sir. The envelope is mailed, Glenview,
April 29, Illinois. But, as you see, it had gone to a lot of addresses, because
I had moved around quite a bit. So we would have to say I got it some time
later than the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, does this involve the question of the undesirable discharge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you ever write to Secretary Connally about that, later
Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I never did write to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right. Will you tell us what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I wrote a letter, and was told how to write the letter.</p>

<p>And this is the answer to the letter.</p>

<p>I won't read it all, because you have a copy. But I have a few points to
make here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall who told you that&mdash;the name of the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was the Marine Base in Fort Worth, Tex., one of the
captains there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Told me who to write to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't remember the name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The letter to Commandant, Marine Air Reserve, 50 JTMGR,
26 April 1962, "to your son was prompted by his request for Soviet citizenship.
An investigation concerning this matter has been conducted by military authorities
and the case will be placed before a board of officers which will recommend
that your son be retained in or separated from the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.
Your son, of course, has the right to appear in person or to present any facts or
evidence which would assist the board in reaching its decision. The letter of
26 April 1960 informed him of his rights. In view of the fact that he has not
been informed&mdash;that he has not informed this headquarters of his current
address, and that he has left the United States without permission, it is considered
that a letter sent to the last address on file at this headquarters is sufficient
notification. A letter will be sent by certified mail informing your son
of a convening date of the board. Should you be aware of any facts or information
which would assist the board in evaluating your son's case, it is suggested
that you forward them to this headquarters. It is regretted that action of this
nature must be taken in your son's case. M.&nbsp;G. Letscher, First Lieutenant, United
States Marine Corps, Administrative Office, Aviation Class 3, Reserve Section."</p>

<p>Now, my letter is important.</p>

<p>Now, this was addressed to me. This is what I want the Commission to
know. This was addressed to Lee, the original. Then I wrote in behalf of
my son, and this was addressed to me.</p>

<p>Then I received a letter addressed to Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>By now, I am corresponding with these people, and I ask for&mdash;I need my letter.
And I ask for the reason for the dishonorable discharge, and said that I would
act in behalf of my son, because I have pertinent information to that fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I will ask the reporter to mark this as the next
number.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 204, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is correspondence with regard to the dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald, will you look at a photostatic copy of that correspondence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is the letter I just read. That is the back of the
envelope. And this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is a very poor copy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Is this the letter we taped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't believe so, no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> I know we taped one, because we could not copy it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. "I desire to <span class="locked">inform"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is your letter of April 10, 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And who did you send it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. May I say this, Mr. Rankin: We did tape that, and I do have a
transcription of it here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "I ask for a stay of action, and I will be willing to act in his
behalf."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald. I will hand you what I am asking the reporter to
mark as Exhibit 205.</p>

<p>I ask you if Exhibit 205 is a correct transcription of your letter.</p>

<p>MRS. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Yes.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 205, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "I am writing you on behalf of my son. He is out of the
country at present, and since I have no contact with him I wish to request a
stay of action concerning his discharge. Also, I desire to be informed of the
charges against him. Please state reasons for such discharge. After hearing
from you, I will be willing to act in his behalf."</p>

<p>So then comes a registered return receipt, addressed only to Mr. Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, will you examine the rest of Exhibit 204 and state whether
that is the rest of the correspondence in regard to the matter that you know
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is addressed to me&mdash;this envelope is addressed to me, that
is right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And those photostatic copies in Exhibit 204 are all copies of
your papers that you furnished to us, so we could make them, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I offer in evidence Exhibits 204 and 205.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> They may be admitted, with those numbers.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 204 and 205 were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, Chief Justice Warren, I am giving information that
this Commission did not have before. I do not think they had this return
addressee, which is important, because after corresponding with me, as Mrs.
Marguerite Oswald, they sent the dishonorable discharge in Lee's name, addressee
only, when they knew he was out of the country.</p>

<p>I would like to know why.</p>

<p>That is another reason why I think that Lee was probably an agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by that, Mrs. Oswald? Could you explain
that a little more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I do not think they wanted me to have the dishonorable
discharge.</p>

<p>Again, they wanted me to be upset and tell people about it, but not have the
proof of the dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Don't you think it is possible that they felt he was the one
involved, and, therefore, they had to get the word directly to him for legal
reasons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, because, legally&mdash;I am glad you brought up the point,
Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Your copies state that anyone can act in your behalf. And I wrote, as I read
the copy, that I would be willing to act in my son's behalf, and I was making
arrangements to get money and go there and act in his behalf because I had
pertinent information. And they ignored my letter and sent this&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They may have felt you had not been given authority to act.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, what they may feel and what they should do&mdash;I am saying
I am an American citizen, and I have some rights. And when I want to act in
behalf of my son, we don't know whether he is living or dead, then I should
act in behalf, I should not get a return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
I am glad you are bringing these points up. My rights have been invaded
and my son's.</p>

<p>I make that statement for the record.</p>

<p>Now, we shall go to Lee's childhood.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, Chief Justice Warren, I have pictures of my son that Mr.
Jenner would like this Commission to have, because it shows Lee at age 15 and
16, and myself, which was supposed to be a life of psychiatric treatment. And
I am more than happy&mdash;I volunteered to help my country in every way possible&mdash;to
let the Commission have everything that I have. But you must understand
that these are very valuable pictures, sir. I am having people wanting rights
to a book, and these pictures are very, very valuable to me. And I would not
want any of these pictures lost. Financially they are valuable, and to my story,
sir. And they are the only pictures in existence.</p>

<p>I have sold a few pictures in order to live.</p>

<p>But the way I have done it&mdash;the photographer had this picture in particular&mdash;have
come to my home and copied the pictures and gave it to me back in my
hand. I cannot afford to have any of these pictures lost, sir. It is my story
that some day I hope to write.</p>

<p>So I was told that if I continue with the life history of Lee as a child and
show the pictures, then they would have to be admitted for the record.</p>

<p>Am I correct, sir?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> That is our way of proceeding, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. So now when I show the pictures, will you personally give me
assurance that these pictures will in no way be used?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> No, I cannot do that. The Commission cannot do it. If
you have something that you consider your personal property, that you do not
want to give to the Commission, you may withhold it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not say, sir, I did not want to give it to the Commission.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Just a minute. I do not believe they bear directly on the
matter we are investigating. They might be helpful. They might not be helpful.
But you may have the choice of determining whether you want to introduce
them or not.</p>

<p>But if you do introduce them, the Commission cannot put any limitation
upon the use that it might make of them.</p>

<p>Now, I don't mean by that that we are going to necessarily distribute them
or anything of that kind. But the Commission cannot limit itself in the reception
of its evidence. It must have the power to do with it whatever is necessary
to develop the facts.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I give you that power. And I voluntarily would like
for you to have everything I have, including pictures. But I just wanted assurance
that these pictures would not be exploited in any way. For some reason
or other&mdash;I am not putting it into words&mdash;but these are my personal pictures.
And I want the Commission to have them. And it is pertinent to the story, I
understand, Mr. Doyle, is that correct&mdash;because it shows Lee smiling, and his
life and my life in New Orleans, which, I understand that the Commission is
very interested in.</p>

<p>Am I not correct, Mr. Doyle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Mrs. Oswald, as the situation has developed here, the introduction
of the pictures into evidence, of course, must necessarily involve their physical
copying, and the retention of the copies in the file. The Commission itself has
stated that it can give you no assurance whatsoever concerning the use of these
papers.</p>

<p>I would, myself, be of the view that the pictures introduced into the record
here would be certainly used for the purposes of the investigation and the purposes
of the Commission as established by the Executive order.</p>

<p>But they can give you no blanket&mdash;or have not chosen to give you any blanket
assurance of the use of the pictures, and have given you completely the choice
that if you have any concern about it whatsoever, that you retain the pictures
yourself.</p>

<p>The choice they have given you is if you wish to have&mdash;to present the pictures
to the Commission in the course of your testimony, they will be glad to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
them, they will&mdash;there will be copies made of them, the originals, of course, will
remain in your custody. Their purposes will be&mdash;their use will be the uses of
the Commission. But the Commission gives you no assurance whatsoever of
the use, and gives you the complete choice of either submitting them or not
under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, being a layman, I understand, I think, what you are
telling me, in a way. But, on the other hand, being a layman, I feel actually
I have no choice.</p>

<p>You have to understand I am not an attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. But you do have a choice, because you are not here under
subpena. Your materials have not been subpenaed. The Commission has
advised you openly here that you may submit them or not as you see fit to do.
So there is no force, no legal force at all. This is absolutely up to you.</p>

<p>The only thing that has been expressed to you is that they can give you
no assurance or guarantee as to what use the Commission will make of
them, that they will make what use they believe in their judgment is required
by the Executive order and the purposes of their investigation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand. And that is why I wanted the Commission
to have all pictures that I have.</p>

<p>Now, may I request something? I don't think it is presumptuous of me.
Maybe it is.</p>

<p>Could I sign for my rights for these pictures, and then let you have the
pictures?</p>

<p>I am afraid that they may get lost.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> I think, Mrs. Oswald, if you have any doubt us to whether
a misuse will be made of your papers, or if they are as valuable, moneywise,
to you as you think they are, then I would suggest to you that you retain
them yourself. We, of course, would be interested to see them, and they
might be helpful&mdash;I don't know, because I don't know what you have there,
or what context the pictures will be in.</p>

<p>But as your lawyer has told you, you are not under subpena here, you
appeared voluntarily because you requested to testify before us. Those
documents are not under subpena. They belong to you. They are in your
possession. I have not seen them. You are at liberty to use them in your
testimony or not, as you please.</p>

<p>But if you do, the Commission cannot put any limitations on the use that
it will make of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Even though you have stated, Chief Justice Warren, just
now, that you do not know if they are valuable to the Commission&mdash;and yet I
have information from Mr. Jenner that they are valuable to the Commission,
because they pertain to Lee's life at age 13 to age 16.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes, I say they might be. I don't know. I have never
seen them.</p>

<p>But the choice is with you, Mrs. Oswald. You may do just as you please.
If you wish to testify concerning them, and put them in the hands of the
Commission, you may do so.</p>

<p>But the Commission cannot limit itself in the use of its testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I want the Commission to have this.</p>

<p>Moneywise, it is more important for the Commission to know this boy's
life and my life&mdash;but also I need to protect myself financially, because I am
a widow, and do not have the money. And this will mean&mdash;these are valuable
pictures.</p>

<p>I am not questioning the integrity of this Commission or the loyalty. What
I am questioning is that possibly they may get lost or someone may somehow
or other get ahold of these pictures and exploit them, and get money for
them, which has happened to some other pictures already, sir, and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Not those that you have given to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;but with <span class="locked">another&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Well, I think, Mrs. Oswald, it would serve no purpose for
us to debate the matter. I have tried to tell you very frankly, and your
lawyer has told you very frankly and correctly, that you have a free choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
to do just as you please. And we will abide by that choice that you may
make.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I confer with my lawyer for about 10 minutes?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Yes. We will take a recess, and you may talk to him.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Come to order, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Last night, Mr. Rankin, I read Lee working at one place
after Tujaque. I do not know the name, sir. I think he worked there just
a few days. He had the keys to the office. And, as I returned home from
work one day, another young man was at the apartment, the door of the
apartment, and said that Lee was discharged, and that Lee had the keys to
the office, and just then Lee walked up and gave this young man the keys.</p>

<p>Now, I do not know the name of the place. And I believe he just worked
there, sir, a few days.</p>

<p>I read that afterwards.</p>

<p>If you will refresh me, I will give you any information I have. But it is
hard for me to think of everything.</p>

<p>I believe we have cleared up the business today that we have missed.</p>

<p>I have decided&mdash;and maybe I am wrong, because to me money is only
good as to its use. However, there have been so many things since the assassination
that has not been in my favor, I believe that I am going to keep my
personal pictures.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> You may do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If at any time in the future that you would like to have
these pictures, I will be more than happy to have copies made and give
them to the Commission.</p>

<p>There is another matter, Mr. Rankin, that is very important, that you
asked me&mdash;Governor Connally's letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had read this at the press conference. A letter from Lee
Harvey Oswald to John Connally, Secretary of the Navy. This is just written
from the newspaper article.</p>

<p>"I have been in the Soviet Union with the full sanction of the U.S. Embassy
in Moscow." He asked the Navy Department to take the necessary steps to repair
the damage to me and my family. "I shall employ all means to right the
gross mistakes or injustices to a bona fide U.S. citizen, an
ex-serviceman."</p>

<p>Now, I do not consider this a threat, because I, myself, if I had a dishonorable
discharge, and I was a good marine for 3 years, and I felt like it hurt my mother
and my children, and my wife, I would make such a statement, because I am a
very definite person, as you know by now. I have been testifying for 3 days. And
my son is of the same nature. He loved the Marines, and as far as he was concerned,
he served his country 3 years. And it was a stigma to me and his
children, and he wanted to right the wrong.</p>

<p>So I do not consider this a threat.</p>

<p>He went to Austin. There was an article in the paper&mdash;trying to get this
rectified, and the young lady gave a very nice report of Lee, said he was very
polite.</p>

<p>This is not a threat.</p>

<p>This is just how Lee was tried immediately in a few hours time, newspaper
talk, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>I would state this emphatically more maybe than Lee did, if I had a dishonorable
discharge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever hear your son say anything against Governor
Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>But here is what I have written down. The day at Robert's house, when I
came in from the country, I, myself, gave Lee the copy&mdash;we had many copies&mdash;you
showed me the copy&mdash;I gave him the copy and told him&mdash;I had written him
and told him about the dishonorable discharge, but I did not send any papers,
because I didn't want the Russians to know.</p>

<p>But when I came, I had a scrapbook, and I gave him a copy, Mr. Rankin, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the reason for dishonorable discharge. He says "Don't worry about it, mother.
I can fix that. It is no problem."</p>

<p>So then the boy tried to fix it. And this is not a threat. My son is of this
disposition, and he felt like he was a good marine. That I know. I would do
the same. And I will read it now to Governor Connally: "I shall employ all
means to right the gross mistake done to my family and my now dead son."</p>

<p>I expect to write to anybody officially to rectify this mistake.</p>

<p>I have shown this publicly at press conferences, and so I will employ all
means to rectify this mistake&mdash;the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald. I intended
to do that. That is my life's work.</p>

<p>I have the name of the man I talked to.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Warren&mdash;I will start from Lee as baby, before I get to this.</p>

<p>Lee was born October 18, 1939, in New Orleans, La. His mother, Marguerite
Claverie Oswald, his father's name was Robert Edward Lee, he was named after
General Lee. The family's name is Harvey&mdash;his grandmother's name was
Harvey. And so he was named Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Lee was born 2 months after the death of his father, who died from a
heart attack, coronary thrombosis.</p>

<p>Lee was a very happy baby.</p>

<p>I stayed home with the children as long as I could, because I believe that a
mother should be home with her children.</p>

<p>I don't want to get into my story, though.</p>

<p>Lee had a normal life as far as I, his mother, is concerned. He had a bicycle,
he had everything that other children had.</p>

<p>Lee has wisdom without education. From a very small child&mdash;I have said this
before, sir, and I have publicly stated this in 1959&mdash;Lee seemed to know the
answers to things without schooling. That type child, in a way, is bored with
schooling, because he is a little advanced.</p>

<p>Lee used to climb on top of the roof with binoculars, looking at the stars. He
was reading astrology. Lee knew about any and every animal there was. He
studied animals. All of their feeding habits, sleeping habits. He could converse&mdash;and
that is why he was at the Bronx Zoo when he was picked up for
truancy&mdash;he loved animals.</p>

<p>Lee played Monopoly. Lee played chess. Lee had a stamp collection, and
even wrote to other young men and exchanged stamps, sir.</p>

<p>And Lee read history books, books too deep for a child his age. At age 9 he
was always instructed not to contact me at work unless it was an emergency,
because my work came first&mdash;he called me at work and said, "Mother, Queen
Elizabeth's baby has been born."</p>

<p>He broke the rule to let me know that Queen Elizabeth's baby had been born.
Nine years old. That was important to him. He liked things of that sort.</p>

<p>He loved comics, read comic books. He loved television programs. But most
of all he loved the news on radio and television. If he was in the midst of a
story, a film&mdash;he would turn it off for news. That was important.</p>

<p>And I have stated in 1959, which is in print, that Lee loved maps. Lee would
study maps, sir. And he could tell you the distance from here and there. And
when he was home on leave, I was amazed. Something was said about an airplane
trip. Immediately he knew how many miles in the air that that plane
took.</p>

<p>Lee read very, very important things. And any and everything he could do.</p>

<p>Yet he played Monopoly, played baseball.</p>

<p>He belonged to the "Y." He used to go swimming. He would come by
work with his head wet, and I would say, "Hurry home, honey, you are
going to catch cold."</p>

<p>And I considered that, sir, a very normal life.</p>

<p>I am probably forgetting some things.</p>

<p>So then Robert joined the Marines in 1956&mdash;am I correct&mdash;that Robert joined
the Marines?</p>

<p>No, Robert joined the Marines in 1952. We are now in Fort Worth,
Tex., until 1952.</p>

<p>So then I decided, since I was working, I did not want Lee to be alone.
Up until this time, sir, he had a brother. So I sold my home at 7400 Ewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Street, and went to New York City, not as a venture, but because my older
son, John Edward Pic, lived in New York, and had lived in New York for
years. He was in the Coast Guard, as a military man. He has now been
in the service 14 years, and at that time it would have been approximately
8 or 9 years&mdash;I may be off because that is approximately. So he was
stationed in New York. So I had no problem of selling my home and
going there, thinking that John Edward would leave New York.</p>

<p>But the main thing was to be where I had family. And I moved to New
York for that reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what date was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was exactly August 1952, because I wanted to get there
in time for Lee's schooling. And if I am not mistaken, Robert joined the
Marines in July of 1952. And that was my reason for going.</p>

<p>I immediately enrolled Lee in a Lutheran school, because Lee was not
confirmed&mdash;he was baptized in the Lutheran faith, but because of moving
around&mdash;I had married Mr. Ekdahl in this period and so on, Lee was not
confirmed.</p>

<p>I enrolled him in the Lutheran school which took him approximately an
hour or longer by subway to get there. It was quite a distance. That is
when we first arrived in New York.</p>

<p>I believe that Lee was in that school a very short time, 2 or 3 weeks, because
at this time I was living in my daughter-in-law's home and son. And we
were not welcome, sir. We were welcome for a few days. But then we were
to get a place of our own&mdash;because her mother lived with her, and her
mother had left to go visit a sister. So Lee and I could come to visit.
But we were not going to live with John and his wife.</p>

<p>So we just stayed there a short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any time that you recall that there was a threat
of Lee Oswald against Mrs. Pic with a knife or anything like that?</p>

<p>Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I do.   I am glad you said that.</p>

<p>My daughter-in-law was very upset. The very first time we went there&mdash;I
stated before, and I am glad I said that&mdash;that we were not welcome.
And immediately it was asked what did we plan to do, as soon as we put our
foot in the house. And I had made it plain to John Edward that I was
going to have a place of my own, that we were just coming there to get
located.</p>

<p>My daughter-in-law resented the fact that her mother&mdash;this went on
before I got there&mdash;that her mother had to leave the house and go visit a
sister so I could come, John Edward's mother. I had never met my daughter-in-law.
She didn't like me, and she didn't like Lee.</p>

<p>So she&mdash;what is the word to say&mdash;not picked on the child, but she showed
her displeasure.</p>

<p>And she is a very&mdash;not, I would say so much an emotional person&mdash;but
this girl is a New Yorker who was brought up in this particular neighborhood,
which I believe is a poor section of New York.</p>

<p>The mother had lived in this home all her life. And this girl cursed like
a trooper. She is&mdash;you cannot express it, Mr. Rankin&mdash;but not of a
character of a high caliber.</p>

<p>At this particular time she had never been out of this neighborhood, or out
of New York. And Lee loved the little baby. And he played with the
baby and wanted to hold the baby and everything, which she objected.</p>

<p>We were not wanted, sir, from the very beginning. So there was, I think
now&mdash;it was not a kitchen knife&mdash;it was a little pocket knife, a child's knife,
that Lee had. So she hit Lee. So Lee had the knife&mdash;now, I remember
this distinctly, because I remember how awful I thought Marjory was about
this. Lee had the knife in his hand. He was whittling, because John
Edward whittled ships and taught Lee to whittle ships. He puts them
in the glass, you know. And he was whittling when this incident occurred.
And that is what it occurred about, because there was scraps of
the wood on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
So when she attacked the child, he had the knife in hand. So she made the
statement to my son that we had to leave, that Lee tried to use a knife on her.</p>

<p>Now, I say that is not true, gentlemen. You can be provoked into
something. And because of the fact that he was whittling, and had
the knife in his hand, they struggled.</p>

<p>He did not use the knife&mdash;he had an opportunity to use the knife.</p>

<p>But it wasn't a kitchen knife or a big knife. It was a little knife.</p>

<p>So I will explain it that way, sir.</p>

<p>So immediately then I started to look for a place.</p>

<p>I did find a place, I think, off the Concourse. I do not remember the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that in the Bronx?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Off the Concourse, in the Bronx. And it was a basement
apartment.</p>

<p>I had shipped some of my furniture. It was in a storehouse at this time.
So I got it out and put it in this basement.</p>

<p>Lee had his own single bed. It was a one&mdash;one great big, big room. But we
had the kitchen&mdash;regular New York type style&mdash;the kitchen and the bedroom and
everything together, but large enough&mdash;a big one-room apartment. And there
was a single bed that Lee slept on, and I slept on the studio couch.</p>

<p>Then Lee went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that Public School 117?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have that information here.</p>

<p>Went to school in the neighborhood, Public School 117, which is a junior
high school in the Bronx. It states here he attended 15 of 47 days. This is the
place we were living that Lee was picked up by the truant officer in the Bronx
Zoo.</p>

<p>I was informed of this at work, and I had to appear before a board, which
I did.</p>

<p>Lee went back to school.</p>

<p>Then he was picked up again in the Bronx Zoo. And I had to appear before
a board committee again.</p>

<p>Then the third time that Lee was picked up, we were&mdash;I never did get a
subpena, but we were told that he had to appear at Children's Court. But I
never&mdash;how I got the notice to appear at Children's Court&mdash;I am at a loss, sir.</p>

<p>But I did not contact at this time a lawyer or anything. I did not know. I
did not think it was anything serious, because the Texas laws are not like the
New York laws. In New York, if you are out of school one day you go to
Children's Court. In Texas the children stay out of school for months at a
time.</p>

<p>Lee had never done this. So I appeared with my son in court. There was
a judge asked me if I want to be represented by court counsel. And I believe
I said, yes, I believe I was represented by the court counsel at this particular
time. And within a few minutes time&mdash;because there were hundreds of people
sitting, waiting with their truant children, and it was just like this&mdash;you didn't
take the time we are taking here, a half hour, to discuss the case. It was done
immediately.</p>

<p>My child was taken from me in the courtroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had he been out of school quite a bit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. At this time, he had not been out of school quite a bit.</p>

<p>So then I was given a slip of paper&mdash;no, I am sorry. I was told where to go,
where Lee was, which was another office.</p>

<p>They took Lee from me in the courtroom, two men, officers, presumably.
Then I went into another office and here was Lee. Lee was wearing his
brother's Marine ring, just an ornament ring. They gave me Lee's ring and
the things he had in his pocket, and told me that Lee was going to be at this
home, which I think the name was the Warwick Home for Boys. And gave
me a slip of paper and told me when I could visit Lee.</p>

<p>And that was all I knew at this particular time.</p>

<p>The child was immediately taken, and I was told to visit the child.</p>

<p>Now, I believe it was&mdash;this home was in Brooklyn. I may have the name
wrong. It was an old, old home in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>So I went to visit my son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
And I hope some day to rectify this, because I think conditions of this kind
in our United States of America are deplorable. And I want that to go down in
the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they tell you why he was taken to this home, your son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For truancy, yes, sir.</p>

<p>So I had to stand single file approximately a block and a half, sir, with
Puerto Ricans and Negroes and everything, and people of my class, single file,
until we got to the main part of this building, which had a wire, a very heavy
wire, partition wire, a man sitting back of the desk, but a man in the front of
the gate that let me in. I had packages of gum and some candy for my son.
And I sat down there. And the gum wrappers were taken off the gum, and the
candy wrappers were taken off.</p>

<p>And my pocketbook was emptied. Yes, sir, and I asked why. It was because
the children in this home were such criminals, dope fiends, and had been
in criminal offenses, that anybody entering this home had to be searched in
case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or anything.</p>

<p>So that is why I was searched.</p>

<p>So I was escorted into a large room, where there were parents talking with
their children.</p>

<p>And Lee came out. He started to cry. He said, "Mother, I want to get out
of here. There are children in here who have killed people, and smoke. I
want to get out."</p>

<p>So then I realized&mdash;I had not realized until I went there what kind of place
we had my child in.</p>

<p>We don't have these kinds of places in Texas or New Orleans, sir.</p>

<p>Then I realized what a serious thing this was. And this is when I decided I
needed an attorney.</p>

<p>But Lee, I think, was approximately in that home&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;5 or 6
weeks, which accounts for his truancy that the papers say that Lee was a truant,
that he was out of school so long.</p>

<p>It is because he was in this home, sir. That accounts for a lot of the truancy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you talk to him about his truancy, say anything to him
about it, or ask him about it, how he happened to stay out of school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I asked Lee.</p>

<p>Well, this comes in another part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. So I left my son that day, and I think I visited him a couple of
times after that. I am not quite sure.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, I engaged an attorney. I do not know the name of the
attorney, and I wish I did.</p>

<p>When I told the attorney about Lee&mdash;and I have stated this at a press conference&mdash;he
raised the roof, so as to say. He was indignant. I cannot quote
his exact words. But what he said was that New York State picked up these
boys and put them on a farm, and they pay these boys to work on this farm
for the State of New York.</p>

<p>Now, I may not be saying this exactly. You may have the picture of the home.</p>

<p>But these boys work on the farm and are paid for it, I understand. That
is all I can remember, sir, about this unpleasant thing, because I did not think
it would ever come in my life, and after the time it happened I tried to put it
out of my mind.</p>

<p>But now I am refreshed a little on that.</p>

<p>So Lee was in this home 5 or 6 weeks, I believe. You probably have the
record.</p>

<p>So then we were asked to appear to court. I went into court with this attorney.
And there, again, real fast we were in the courtroom and Lee was brought
in, and Lee sat down by me. And I remember this distinctly, because Lee had
ear trouble quite often. And I saw his ear running, and I said, "Lee, you are
having an earache." And the judge heard me saying something to Lee.</p>

<p>He said, "What did you tell your boy, Mrs. Oswald?"</p>

<p>I said, "Judge, I asked him if he had an earache."</p>

<p>I didn't know they were going to give me the child then.</p>

<p>So the judge talked to Lee and asked Lee if he was going to be good, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
go back to school. Lee answered, "Yes, sir." And he said to me, "Mrs. Oswald,
I understand that you and your daughter-in-law do not get along." I said, "That
is correct." And he suggested that Lee would be much better off back in the open
wide spaces that he was used to instead of in New York, where we had no
family then, because the daughter-in-law and son were not friendly with us.
And this judge suggested that. And the judge gave me my son, right then and
there, gentlemen.</p>

<p>I left the courtroom with my boy. He was given to me in my custody.</p>

<p>Now, that is all I know of the case. The particular case.</p>

<p>From there, we went into an office where there was a probation officer, Mr.
John Carro. Mr. Carro talked with Lee and asked Lee if he was going to go
back to school.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>He reprimanded him a little bit&mdash;maybe not that, but gave him a little talk.
And he said, "Lee, you are to report to me once a week for probation."</p>

<p>I am going to stress this.</p>

<p>I have been in this Commission 3 days. And you know I am very definite.
So I was very definite with Mr. Carro. I did not mince my words. I said,
"Mr. Carro, my son is not reporting to you once a week. This is not a criminal
offense. He was picked up for truancy, he has assured the judge, promised the
judge that he would be back to school. He has promised you he would be back
to school. Let's give this boy a chance, and let's see if he will go to school."</p>

<p>"And then, Mr. Carro, if he doesn't go to school, then you can have him report
to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Carro didn't take that graciously, which is true. When you don't agree
with anyone over you, then you are in the minority, and you just as well make
up your mind right then and there, that is it.</p>

<p>So from that time on Mr. Carro pestered me and Lee. Mr. Carro would call
me at work, sir, and say that he had gone by the school, and that they were
having trouble with Lee. And I went to the school and talked to the principal
and she said, "Mrs. Oswald, what happened while the probation officer was
here&mdash;Lee moved the chair back, and it made a little noise."</p>

<p>And that is what Mr. Carro reported.</p>

<p>In plain words, gentlemen, Mr. Carro was indignant at my attitude, because
he was an official.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What school was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was the first school, sir.</p>

<p>Then I moved. I am a little confused. Just a minute.</p>

<p>I took Lee out of the first school because the children knew that he had been
in the home, and I thought he didn't stand a chance.</p>

<p>So I moved to help my child again.</p>

<p>And I personally went with Lee to the principal and told the principal&mdash;not
in front of Lee&mdash;had a talk with her&mdash;that Lee had been in this home,
and that if she could help him in any way, and knew of any friends, children
his age that lived in the neighborhood where we lived, I would appreciate it.
And she did help. There was a young lady in this building that we lived, in
the Bronx&mdash;now we are living near the Bronx Zoo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is this the new school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the new school. And we are living near the Bronx Zoo,
which is 100 and something street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And this is Public School 44?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;Public School 44. So I talked to the principal and
told her about the trouble and asked if she could not help us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the place that he was committed to was&mdash;do you recall
that was Berkshire Farms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, because he was not committed to a farm, as far as I knew,
sir. All I knew was that he was in this home in Brooklyn. He was never committed
to a farm, as far as I know, sir. He was in this home all this time.
And this is where I am assuming, because I knew nothing about this&mdash;the
psychiatric treatment took place, and naturally that is why they would have
him in this home to observe him.</p>

<p>And, by the way, I was called one day to go to the home and a young lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
talked with me. And I sensed that she was questioning me for a reason,
because I had been on my own all these years, and I am a business woman. So
I remembered one distinct incident. She said, "Mrs. Oswald, how strong do
you believe in education?"</p>

<p>And I said, "I believe strongly in education, but not to an extent that a mother
should go out and work and deprive her children of a mother's home and love
in order to make the extra money to give her children a college education,"
because I happen to know that a college education sometimes is not as important
as wisdom. There are college graduates that do not know how to apply their
ability. And so to me&mdash;I could never be home with my children. I had to work
and leave my children&mdash;which was a very sore spot, let's say. I would have
given the world if I could have been home and raised my children. And here
are women, because of material things, and because they want to give their
children a college education, deprive their children of this motherly love, that
I myself was deprived of because of an unfortunate affair.</p>

<p>So to get education to that extent, no, sir, I do not approve of it. I think it
is more important for children to come home and have someone in that home
when they come home from school, and do without a college education. I am
strongly for that, because of my experience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was Lee Oswald a good student?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have his records from all the schools in New Orleans, sir.
But we are not through with New York&mdash;that will show he passed satisfactory
grades.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How about New York? Was he a good student there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think he was an average student. Yes.</p>

<p>Now, I personally brought Lee to the school and talked to some of the teachers.
And they told me that Lee was a bright boy, but that he was bored with
school&mdash;there was just something there. Lee was in a sense bored with school
in this sense&mdash;that Lee was an overly bright boy, studious boy, and he should
have been placed in a school that we have now, I understand, for special
children of this sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But his grades were not too good during this period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They were passing grades, I would say. Now, that is what I
know about the New York situation.</p>

<p>Now, it has come out, gentlemen, that he had had psychiatric treatment there.
I did not know of any psychiatric treatment there. But now I am assuming
naturally he did have it then. There is a report on it.</p>

<p>I wish to say this. I am just a practical nurse. I became a nurse because of
my experiences, and I wanted to devote my life to humanity, which I have stated
before. But I do know this. I work in hospitals, rest homes, private homes, and
all of our hospitals, and all of our rest homes, and all of our institutions are
understaffed.</p>

<p>Now, I think you will agree there. We are all understaffed. Every one I
have ever been in. So I will say if Lee had psychiatric treatment in this home,
there are hundreds and hundreds of children, he could not have had a complete
psychiatric examination. We do not know. I do not know if he had a complete.
But I will say that according to other institutions, that this institution was also
understaffed.</p>

<p>I am going to make one remark to Mr. Jack Ruby. He has to have five
psychiatrists. Now, here is one little psychiatric examination on a 13-year-old
boy.</p>

<p>So, then we will go to Lee's schooling in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you leave New York, did you ever tell anybody that you
took Lee Oswald to New York so he could have mental tests at the Jacobi
Hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, never. My child was a normal child&mdash;and while in
New York. I explained to you he had a dog with puppies. The school teachers
talked well about him. He had a bicycle. There was nothing abnormal about
Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>It has been stated also I was offered psychiatric treatment which is incorrect.
This Mr. Carro I understand is a very big man. He may be supplying
the files with all of this. But, sir, it is untrue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then you went to New Orleans after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. Then they assigned a big brother to Lee. This is important
to the story.</p>

<p>So this man came out to the apartment on several occasions and saw the
type person I was and my son was. And he did not see anything wrong with
the child. Evidently not. Because he suggested that it might be a good idea&mdash;I
had told him the way Mr. Carro was doing. Mr. Carro was pestering me,
sir, at work, with just little insignificant reports that I would call the school and
the principal would assure me everything was all right.</p>

<p>So he thought that it would be better if I would take the child away. And
I didn't know I could do that. I didn't know exactly the charge.</p>

<p>So, I said, "Is it all right? They won't arrest us and bring us back?"</p>

<p>He said, "No, there is no extraditing"&mdash;that was his words.</p>

<p>So, I wrote Mr. Carro a letter explaining that I was taking&mdash;Lee and I were
going to New Orleans, and Lee had cousins his age in New Orleans, and I thought
the child would be better off amongst his own family. And the judge had
recommended that if we could possibly leave New York that it would be better
for Lee. And I wrote Mr. Carro the letter, sir. I did not flee New York. I had
the decency to write him a letter. And the Big Brother is the one that recommended
this.</p>

<p>Now, that is what I know of the New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember the name of the Big Brother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not know the name of the Big Brother. But from
the newspaper accounts, they know the name. The Big Brother stated how
clean the apartment was, and how nice we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then you went to New Orleans, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Then we went to New Orleans. And we stayed at
my sister's house, 757 French Street, and immediately Lee enrolled in&mdash;let's get
back to this. This is in Fort Worth, Tex. Lee attended the Ridglea West School
and graduated&mdash;was promoted to junior high in 1952. In 1952 is when we went
to New York. Now, we are in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Lee was immediately enrolled in Beauregard School in New Orleans, La., upon
arriving in New Orleans. And here is his certificate of promotion to high school.
And they have stated that his attendance was very good. He just missed 9 days,
I think, out of the whole term, which is considered very good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How was he as a student in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. C grades. He was promoted, or he wouldn't have C grades. So
that is two certificates there.</p>

<p>Then I have another certificate. He went to&mdash;no, I would not have the
certain, and then from the promotion he was promoted to the Warren Easton
High School. And that is the school that Lee wrote the note&mdash;am I correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes. It is already in evidence. He wrote and said you were
going to San Diego, and it was not your note at all. He signed your name.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right. And then, as you know, Robert was discharged
from the Marines, and Robert did not want to live in New Orleans. So there
again&mdash;so we could be a family&mdash;and this young boy, who was the youngest,
could be with a brother. I moved back to Fort Worth, sir, because Robert was
in Fort Worth so we could be a family again. However, I moved in July, and
Lee joined the Marines in October. So we were just there a few months.</p>

<p>Lee attended Arlington High School there. And when we came back to Fort
Worth, Tex., the school did not know what to do with Lee. Lee, I think, was
approximately 2 weeks entering the school. He was too far advanced from the
New Orleans and New York schools, and not advanced enough&mdash;let's see if I can
explain this right&mdash;according to his age. He was too old to be in the junior,
or vice versa. But I do know, and I have witnesses to this, that Lee could not
immediately enter school. They had to have a conference, a board conference,
because of Lee's curriculum from school. They didn't know which school to
place him in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he get along with you? Did you get along well
together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Lee was a very quiet and studious boy. None of my
children gave me any trouble, thank God. We have no police record, sir, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
anything like that. And the children were always more or less home. And
particularly Lee. Lee would go to the movies, and things like that. He was a
normal boy. But when he was home, he was most happy. And I am of this
disposition.</p>

<p>He could keep himself occupied&mdash;reading and when he watched a football
game on television, he would have the score pad, and things of that sort. And so
he was quite happy in his own way.</p>

<p>Now, here is something very important.</p>

<p>While in New Orleans, in order to go to Arlington Heights school, which is
one of the ritziest schools in New Orleans, all the wealthy people go there, and
we happened to live in the vicinity&mdash;Lee wanted a two-wheel bicycle, sir, and
I bought him one. So when school opened, Lee went to school on a two-wheel
bicycle. Can you picture this. A 16½-year-old boy going to school on a bicycle,
when all the other children had their own cars? Just picture this. My children
never did want anything, and particularly Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he get along with his brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, at this time he didn't know too much about his
brothers. John Edward had been in the service since age 17, so it has been a
number of years, other than leaves. And Robert had just finished his 3-year
hitch. So you see the brothers have had nothing to do with Lee since age 13
actually&mdash;otherwise than visits. Because when Robert came back, then Lee
joined the Marines.</p>

<p>Now, this is the U.S. Marine Corps acceptance. And it says "I am very
pleased to notify you that your son, Lee Harvey Oswald, has successfully passed
the mental, moral, and physical examinations," and so forth. My son was a
marine. And I understand a very important marine.</p>

<p>He was in electronics. I have read&mdash;one of the marines that was with him
said when he defected to Russia they had to change the system. He must have
had a real responsible position, if Lee defected to Russia, and all the systems
had to be changed. I don't know if this is correct. But this man made the
statement, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he have any courts-martial that you knew about while he
was in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not know until what came out in the paper. And I have
discussed that with several high officials, marines, and so on and so forth. A lot
of men, they tell me, carry a gun. And if you did curse an officer, that is done
sometimes, too&mdash;that is not anything criminal. I mean we all get provoked at
some particular time. I am not taking up for the boy. I don't know what
happened. But I know I myself would be guilty of that, if someone pushed me,
that I may curse him. And I am sure it is done quite often. And I understand
that Lee slashed his wrist. I find that from the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know anything about that? How that happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;otherwise than what I know in the paper. I do not
know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about a man that was killed, that was one of his buddies
in the Marines?</p>

<p>Did you ever know anything about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. This is the first time I have heard about that. I haven't
even read that in the paper. I did not know about that. If I can help you in
any way&mdash;his picture in the Marines&mdash;there are names of the men on the back.
I do not know what they mean. But the names of the men are on the back of
picture, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. When was it that he slashed his wrist&mdash;in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand when he was in Moscow&mdash;is that correct? I do
not know otherwise from what I read in the paper. These things, how could
I know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I see that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And that is why, too, it has been stated that he was
possibly an agent, to show, when the Russians would not give him citizenship,
he slashed his wrist, to show that he did not want to return back to the United
States, and forced the Russians to keep him there. That has been stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever know that he shot himself while he was in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I read that in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He never told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. And I read in the paper that it could have been an
accident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know anything about how good a shot he was? Did he
ever tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee came home with a trophy, but it is a Marine trophy&mdash;may
I have that please, I need a number. It is not on this. We have another picture.
But it had Lee Harvey Oswald. But it was given not to him, but to the platoon.
And he was very, very proud of it. Lee was very proud of his Marine hitch,
because every time he came on leave, that is all he talked about. That I know.
And I am the only one that knows this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that trophy with regard to marksmanship?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. Now, Marina would have that. I gave that to Lee and
Marina when they returned from Russia, and the Marine book that Lee was so
proud of, and the baby book that I had all these years. And I think it was in
regard to marksmanship.</p>

<p>Now, I have Lee's&mdash;they are copying all of this, Mr. Doyle&mdash;Lee's shooting
record. I have that, sir. I have anything you want. It was left in his sea
bag. And all of this was left in Lee's sea bag.</p>

<p>This is a picture of Lee with his marines, and, it is a special, I think he was
doing special work there. I am not familiar&mdash;I wasn't told that. But it is
different than the other picture. Lee went to many, many a school, gentlemen.
He went to the Marine Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, to schooling. He
went to Jacksonville and some others. I remarked, "Your brothers were not
sent from here to there like you were." Lee was in Japan, Lee was in Corregidor,
Lee was in the Philippines, and Lee was in Formosa. That has not been
publicly stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know what schooling he had at these various places?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I would think that it was special schooling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He never told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. But the other brothers didn't have that type schooling.
And I even remarked about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever hear your son say anything for or against President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. While Marina and Lee were in my home that month, and I had
a <span class="locked">television&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was July, 1962&mdash;when they stayed the month with me.
Yes, they were delighted with President Kennedy, both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did they say about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing political&mdash;just "Like President Kennedy." He was
telling Marina about President Kennedy. "I like President Kennedy"&mdash;"I like,
too."</p>

<p>My son has never said anything to me politically about anyone. My son loved
the Marines, and loved his work and has never, never said anything against&mdash;the
only time I questioned my son was ask him why he decided to come home,
and he said, "Not even Marina knows that."</p>

<p>That was the one question I wanted to know, because of the many things
that they sent me from Russia, as I have previously stated. That was the
only thing. So that satisfied me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know anything about his guns&mdash;what guns he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, this is very important, and I am glad you brought this up.
This is the part in New Orleans that I forgot about.</p>

<p>While Lee was working for Tujague &amp; Co. he started to have a bank account,
and it was in a Homestead. I do not know the name, but it was on Canal
Street, 900 or 100 block of Canal Street, because it was even with Exchange
Place. And he started to save his money. The purpose of saving his money
was to go on a tour with a young group. He was working for a steamship
place as a mess engineer so he was going around to all of these seagoing trips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
And I saw the brochure. It was sponsored by very prominent people. There
was nothing wrong with it. If he wanted to go, that was all right&mdash;could go on
this. So he started to save his money to go. However, this was in January&mdash;you
want the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Are we in 1955 in New Orleans? Yes. No, 1956 this would be.
January, 1956&mdash;Lee took his money out of the Homestead, which was approximately
$150, or something like that. And Lee Harvey Oswald bought an electric
football machine&mdash;cost approximately $10. He bought a bow and arrow set&mdash;maybe
about $6 or $7. And he bought a gun. Now, I don't know about guns.
I was going to say BB gun, but I will not say it was a BB gun&mdash;but Robert
Oswald will know&mdash;or a rifle. But it was not an expensive gun. He was just
16½ years old. And I am of the opinion if he bought a real gun, I would have
had to sign or something. I may be wrong. But anyhow it was a gun to go
squirrel hunting or rabbit hunting. I will identify it like that. And then
we can go into it further.</p>

<p>And he paid $35 on a coat for me. And the very first job that&mdash;the very
first pay that Lee got from this job from Tujague sir, he came home with a bird
cage on a stand that had a planter. It had the ivy in the planter, it had the
parakeet, and it had a complete set of food for the parakeet. His very first
pay. And then he paid his room and board. I kept this bird cage&mdash;the stand
was collapsible&mdash;all these years, in the back of my car, and put it up, no matter
where I was on a case, and had the bird up until about 2 years ago&mdash;no, I had
the bird, and gave it to Lee when they came back from Russia. What has become
of it I do not know. I gave the bird and bird cage to Lee and Marina when
they came back from Russia. I am trying to give you the picture of this boy.
Would you ask me some more questions, please? It is awful hard for me to
remember everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember any other guns he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. This is the only gun that I have known Lee to have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, about Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Let me finish about Robert and his gun. This is important
to you.</p>

<p>When we came to New Orleans, I worked at Washer Bros., in New Orleans&mdash;transferred
from&mdash;Goldrings in New Orleans is Washer Bros. in Fort Worth,
Tex. So I worked at Washer Bros. Lee came into the place I worked one
day with the gun and wanted me to sign a paper so he could sell the gun.
Well, I was indignant that he came where I was working with a gun. I said,
"Lee, we will talk about it later." And several of the salesladies thought that
I brushed him off real fast. Well, now, Robert bought that gun from Lee,
and gave Lee $10 for the gun. It was 3 months we were living in New Orleans.
So Robert gave Lee $10 for the gun. And Robert used to go hunting with it
at his mother-in-law's house. I have stated they live in the country and they
go rabbit and squirrel hunting. Robert would know about the gun, the type
gun and everything. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have told us all you know about the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is all I know about the gun. And Robert bought the gun
from Lee, gave him $10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You haven't told us whether you thought your son killed Officer
Tippit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I strictly do not believe that Lee killed Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I am sorry to have to elaborate so, but this, as you
know, is very important.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane and myself are investigating, with hundreds of investigators. I
have over 1,500 letters. We have reporters and people investigating for us,
that are not satisfied with the whole case. And Mr. Lane has a lot of affidavits.
I cannot say what Mr. Lane has. But he is doing a very good job about this.
And we have come to the conclusion that Lee is not guilty of Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Now, I gave you a picture yesterday&mdash;you might have it there, I don't know,
Mr. Rankin&mdash;that could possibly be Marina and the child. We have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
out that the Book Depository Building&mdash;Mr. Lane has this information&mdash;it is
owned by the city of Dallas&mdash;I should not go into that, I don't know. He has
all of this information. Or it is a lease. It is government-owned some way
or other. I should not say. Mr. Lane has all of this. We have been investigating
night and day.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Well, we have the picture, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right. On the picture, then&mdash;and I have talked to Mr.
Doyle about this&mdash;you might think I am crazy to say so. The first thing I saw
in this picture&mdash;this picture was sent to me by a woman with a letter telling
me to look at the picture carefully. I did not read the letter. I did not want
her opinion, or other people's opinion about this picture. We have a lot of
comments about this picture. I immediately looked at the picture when I
opened it. The first thing I saw was my son Lee and Marina and the child.
Then when I called this woman long distance. I said, "You want to know what
I saw in the picture?" and I told her. She says, "No, that is not what I see."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> Did you say your first reaction was that you saw Lee,
Marina and the child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was my first reaction. And, if I am correct&mdash;I don't
say I am correct&mdash;but if I am correct, this would be the solution. Lee was
escorted out of the building. Kennedy is shot now&mdash;I will have to show you
the picture. He has passed the window where Lee's rifle is supposed to be.
And he is shot in the neck. He has passed this particular part. He is shot
in the neck. And then this man that I think is Lee&mdash;and I wish I could swear
to it, but I am fully convinced&mdash;is being escorted out of the building and could
be escorted&mdash;I am speculating, sir&mdash;I have no proof of this. I wish I did.
Could be escorted out of the building by a policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is the picture you are looking at the one you referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it is&mdash;Exhibit 203.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 203?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, this is who I think Lee is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There is no face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the man right in the doorway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. This is Lee's build and everything. The first thing
I saw.</p>

<p>Now, they think this is Lee.</p>

<p>No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Everybody thinks this is Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you say they think&mdash;it is the man leaning against the
side of the doorway, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. That is the picture that everybody is convinced is Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you think it is the one next to him that doesn't show any
face? It shows the arms over the head?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He has his arms up in the air.</p>

<p>Now, that is what I saw immediately&mdash;against everybody else seeing it. And
this woman and child could possibly be Marina.</p>

<p>Now, to explain this&mdash;whether I thought Lee shot Officer Tippit or not&mdash;Lee
could be escorted out of this building with a gun in his back possibly. I am
just speculating, sir. But there is a lot of speculation in this case all over the
world. From foreign countries I have letters. And that is how he got out of
the building. And this same officer could have been killed, because he was involved
in this, and then he could have been killed, to be kept quiet. There is a
possibility of this, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, will you take this blue pencil and carefully mark
on Exhibit 203?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't mean to be telling this Commission what to do. And I
cannot do it. But I would like to have this picture printed. And I am willing&mdash;I
have some few dollars&mdash;I have been selling some pictures. I am willing to
give a reward of $1,000 if this picture can be printed and these people come&mdash;it
would have to be Secret Service, FBI, and state their names.</p>

<p>I would like to have the people here&mdash;let us find out who those people are.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin.</span> Will you mark the letter "A" above the part that you have circled
on Exhibit 203, that you say are Marina and the little girl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And "B" over what you circled as being your idea of Lee Oswald
being there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, that is what I saw, and nobody else has seen this. They
see the man next to him.</p>

<p>Would you want me to put the man next to it that they see as Lee? He has
the same clothes on as Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Well&mdash;you can testify the man that other people said was Lee
Oswald, that you pointed to before on Exhibit 203, would be the one in between,
would that be right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He has the same clothes as Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, we offer in evidence Exhibit 203 as now marked
with the identification.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was received, as indicated, as Commission Exhibit
No. 203.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have any other reasons why you think that Officer Tippit
was not killed by your son Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, Mr. Mark Lane has affidavits. And we are investigating
this&mdash;if you will have his testimony. He has pertinent information to this. I
intend, when I finish here&mdash;I am going to be very quiet about what happened
here, with no comments. But when I finish here, I am going on speaking tours.
I am going to continue the investigation of the shooting. This is for you. But I
intend to continue as long as this Commission is in session, to investigate, like
we have been doing, we have come up with some <span class="locked">very&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Some very what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Very important factors in this case.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Well, I thought that is what you were here to tell us about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not the investigator. Mr. Lane is the investigator. Mr.
Lane is my son's attorney, representing my son. And he is investigating the
death of President Kennedy and the consequent murder of my son.</p>

<p>And he is making tours. And we have these reporters. And we have people
giving us their opinions. We have many, many letters from expert riflemen.
And I have in my possession&mdash;they also write to me&mdash;that have gone through
this particular instance, and say it cannot possibly be done in that length of
time and so on and so forth. We have a lot of expert opinions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you willing to give those to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, we want to. This is what I say is our American way
of life. This boy was shot down handcuffed, within a few hours time, without
trial or jury or counsel, even. He did not have a right to defend himself. So
Mr. Lane immediately started to defend this boy. And people have come to our
rescue.</p>

<p>When I read Mr. Lane's brief, and I realized the truth of some of the statements
he said, I contacted Mr. Lane, as you know, and we tried to come before
the Commission.</p>

<p>So from now on, when I am through with this Commission, I am going to work
with Mr. Lane in my own way&mdash;I am booked in New York on a tour next week.
And I am going to talk only about the investigation.</p>

<p>We have help, sir. We have Mr. Laurence Ross, who is in New Zealand, who
writes articles&mdash;very good. And Captain Wooster, is an expert rifleman of New
Zealand. He does this all the time. He goes all over.</p>

<p>I am not saying it correctly.</p>

<p>But he is an expert. And he said that he himself could hardly do it. And
he practices all the time. That is his&mdash;that is what he does for a living. He is
an expert.</p>

<p>And we have many, many such letters. I have 1,500 letters, sir. Mr. Doyle has
seen my letters and read a few.</p>

<p>We have attorneys writing us. We have ministers. We have all types of
people that are not satisfied with this boy being charged with the assassination
of President Kennedy. And, of course, not satisfied with the way he was shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
down without trial. And we are going to continue to investigate and fight this
in our own way, when I leave the Commission, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Do you have an agent for this tour, lecture tour you are
making?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not. Mr. Lane has&mdash;well, I don't say booked me,
because that would not be the word. But I am supposed to appear Monday at
Town Hall in New York&mdash;no, Tuesday, the 18th. It is going to be a forum.
There are three very prominent men going to be on the panel. And we are
going to ask questions and talk. We will have our public support by bringing
these matters before the public, because we are convinced&mdash;and there are millions
of other people convinced, also&mdash;that this is not as plain as it seems to be,
that there is more to it. And they are not satisfied.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to investigate, with the help of the public.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Are you to be compensated for these lectures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. My trip is being paid to New York. And I am to live
in a home with a family.</p>

<p>As far as that, I know nothing else about this.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Who does know the details of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, now, Mr. Lane would know the details. And maybe you
think I am being a very foolish woman. But here. When I read&mdash;because I have
been very cautious so let's say now I am not being cautious. But here is why.
When I read Mr. Lane's brief&mdash;and I don't know, gentlemen, if you have read it&mdash;but
I believe it would be pertinent to this Commission to get a copy. It is
written in the Guardian&mdash;two or three briefs. And I was convinced this man
had some pertinent ideas about it. And when I engaged Mr. Lane, he said,
"Mrs. Oswald, I will tell you about myself."</p>

<p>I said, "I do not want to hear. As far as I am concerned, you could be a Communist.
But to me a Communist is a human being. That is just his way of life."</p>

<p>We are Americans. We have Japanese people. That is their way of life. A
Communist, as long as he is not hurting our Government, that is his right to
be a Communist. That is his way of life.</p>

<p>I did not want to know anything about Mr. Lane, because I knew Mr. Lane
wrote sensible things, that Mr. Lane was interested. And what he wrote made
sense. And that is all I am interested in, sir.</p>

<p>If Mr. Lane is getting money, and I am appearing, that is just fine. I am not
interested. If I can get before the public and through Mr. Lane doing it, I want
to get before that public and state my American way of life and try to prove
my son is innocent.</p>

<p>The main part of this is to try to prove Lee Harvey Oswald innocent.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman.</span> Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said during your testimony that an agent showed you a
picture at the Six Flags Inn. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, and I am glad you brought that up, because I have notes
on this, too. I have something important to say about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will ask the reporter to mark this.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 237 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Before I see a picture, see&mdash;if it was in a square, cupped in a
hand, I believe it would be better for me for identification. That is the way
I saw it. It was cupped in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, all I have is Exhibit 237, in the shape it is in.
And I will hand it to you and ask you if you recall that as being the picture
that was shown to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. This is not the picture shown me. The picture that
was shown me was a full face and just shoulders. This is not the picture.</p>

<p>This picture was about this size, very glossy black and white, with a big face
and shoulders. I have background here, a lot of white. But this took the
whole picture&mdash;the face and shoulders. And this door was just ajar. And this
man had this picture&mdash;and the two corners were cut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what size is the picture you are looking at?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is about three by four&mdash;approximately three by four, cupped
in this man's hand, and the two corners were cut. The two top corners. And a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
very glossy picture, black and white, with a big face and shoulders. This is the
picture shown me, sir.</p>

<p>Now, at Six Flags Inn, about 3 days later, when I entered the room, on the
table were a lot of newspapers. I walked into the room in the presence of my
son, and all of the agents. As I stated before, Marina and I knew nothing of
what went on. We did not know how Lee was shot or anything, because we did
not sit down and watch television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What son are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Robert. So this is approximately the Wednesday, the 25th&mdash;no&mdash;Sunday
was the 24th. About the 26th&mdash;it was a few days after Lee was
shot, a couple of days. So I walked into the room, and I picked this paper up
and turned it over, and I exclaimed, "This is the picture of the man that the
FBI agent showed me."</p>

<p>And one of the agents said, "Mrs. Oswald, that is the man that shot your son."</p>

<p>Believe me, gentlemen, I didn't even ask his name. And nothing more was
said.</p>

<p>Now, that is very unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, the picture that you are talking about that you picked up,
was a picture in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the newspaper. The bottom part of the newspaper. I can
see that like I can see the picture. I had never seen the picture before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you later learn whose picture that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, when I returned to my home in Fort Worth, Tex., about a
week later, Mr. Blair Justice, of the Star Telegram, brought me all the papers,
that was the next time I saw the pictures and knew it was Mr. Ruby. And it
was a bottom page, and it was this picture shown me.</p>

<p>Now, this is what I want to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Tell us who was there when you said that, about the picture
in the paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Mike Howard, Mr. Garry Seals&mdash;well, all of the agents
there. The room was full. And Robert Oswald was there. The room was full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was Marina there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina was in the bedroom. Marina and I stayed in the bedroom
with the children. We could get snatches of the television and so on. The
children had diarrhea and so on. We were busy.</p>

<p>As I picked the paper up and turned it over, it was on the back. This picture
I saw, the same picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether your son Lee Oswald knew Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have no way of knowing that. I just hope that he
did, if I am right. If Lee is an agent, I hope he knew Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> When you made that statement, after looking at the
newspaper, did you say it loudly enough for people in the room to hear it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, because they answered me. They said, "That is the
picture of the man that shot your son."</p>

<p>But nothing has been said since that. That is the part that I question all
about this.</p>

<p>And then I am not asked to be subpenaed at Jack Ruby's trial or anything.</p>

<p>The FBI says yes, they showed me a picture, but that wasn't a picture of
Jack Ruby, not even giving me a chance.</p>

<p>I don't understand. Something is not according to Hoyle. I keep telling you
gentlemen.</p>

<p>Now, I can identify this picture, I believe, out of a hundred pictures.</p>

<p>It was a black and white glossy picture of a big face and shoulders. And why
I express it&mdash;he had it cupped in his hand, and he poked his arm and his hand
with my bifocals, and all I could see was the picture and the hand. I didn't
even see Mr. Odum so much. That was that hand poked in front of me. I am
positive of this. Yet I am not asked any more about the picture. They state, yes,
they showed me a picture, but not this picture. I am positive, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will ask you about a list of names and see if you know any of
them, or if your son, Lee Oswald, knew any of them, to your knowledge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will be happy to answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Karen Bennett, do you know that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I have inquired about this Karen Bennett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know whether I knew her or not. I have asked several
people to investigate this for me.</p>

<p>Upon returning from the country on an OB case. I went to work for Royal
Clothiers, in Fort Worth, Tex., as an outside sales lady. In OB you have to wait
for the babies&mdash;and I needed to live. There was a young lady there by the name
of Carol, I called her. It could be Karen. Looked very much like the young
lady I saw on the television. That is the first time I connected the two. Her
father was one of the biggest gangsters in Fort Worth, Tex. And he himself was
killed by the gangland of Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Why I know that&mdash;the manager of this Royal Clothiers had remarked who
Karen's father was, and I said to him, "I don't appreciate your broadcasting that.
I think what her father did has nothing to do with the girl. She is working.
Give her a chance to her own life."</p>

<p>I am always standing up and getting myself in trouble. I want you to know
that. Maybe I am not liked. But if that makes not being liked, I will continue
not being liked, sir.</p>

<p>So this is when I first started to work. However, I found out that the young
lady also had another job at night, which is all right. She was working as a
barmaid in a tavern on Hemphill Street, in Fort Worth, Tex., and she had two
small children, and so if she worked at the Royal Clothiers during the day, it was
necessary that she work at this saloon, or whatever you want to call it at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was she married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, she was not married. That maybe is what she had to do to
support her children. And I understand, because I was left alone.</p>

<p>But&mdash;she and I became involved in this way. In the front of the store was a
showcase with cheap jewelry. This is a credit place, rings, diamond rings, and
bracelets. And Carol had the key to this case, and so did I. And there was
some talk about a ring or something missing. I realized right then and there
I could not put myself in a position of things being stolen, because here was a
girl who they said her father was a gangster, and she was working in a bar.
And my son was a known defector. So I quit that job.</p>

<p>Now, on television for the Ruby trial here comes the girl. I thought I recognized
this girl. The name is Karen Bennett. And I called her Carol, it could
be Karen Bennett. I didn't have much to do with the girl. So I immediately
told this story to Mr. Jack Langueth of the New York Times, and I told also
to another Star Telegram reporter, Mr. John McConnoch, because I wanted
them to investigate.</p>

<p>But I have not heard anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How about Bruce Carlin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't know whether your son knew him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I would not know anybody that my son knew. That
I am positive&mdash;because he never did tell me any of this. But continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Robert Kermit Patterson, also known as Bobby Patterson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Donald C. Stuart?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Charles Arndt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. James A. Jackson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, you know, a few of those names sound to me like they might
be on the back of both of these pictures. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. They are supposed to be associates or friends or people that
Mr. Ruby knew and associated with closely.</p>

<p>Stanley or Katya Skotnicki?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Larry Crafard, or Crawford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember that name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I was trying to connect the name with a couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether he ever spent any time in the Silver Spur?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If Lee ever did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have had no knowledge of Lee for 1 year. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And before that do you know whether he spent any time in the
Silver Spur in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>And before that, as to what I do know, that Lee did not drink and Lee did
not smoke, and Lee wasn't the type&mdash;not that he did not maybe go into saloons&mdash;but
from what I know of him, he did not go into places like that of his own.
If he was working he might have gone into these places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. These are the nightclubs Jack Ruby was associated with. You
recognize that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the Vegas Club was another one. Do you know whether
he spent time there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would have no way of knowing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the Sovereign Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have no way of knowing. I am going to say, again, Mr. Lane
would have ways of knowing about all these clubs and everything, because
that is his part of our investigation. I would like to get back to Patrolman
Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right. I just want to try to cover this book about Lee
Oswald's marksmanship. That has been marked Exhibit 238.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 238, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It is a book that you brought here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was left in his sea bag, when he came home from the
Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And that reads, "U.S. Marine Corps Score Book, Oswald, L. H."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is your son's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. That is his platoon, 2060, that is the one he
got the trophy with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were the various marks in that book in pencil that you see
there in the book when you first found it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have not touched the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is it in the same condition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is the same condition that it was in his sea bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 238, and ask leave to substitute
a copy.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be introduced.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked as Commission Exhibit No. 238 was received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, will you mark this 239?</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 239 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald. I will ask you to glance through Exhibit 239
and state whether or not that appears to be photostatic copy <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is the photostatic <span class="locked">copy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Of Exhibit 238?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you will see it has the same markings.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is a copy we will substitute.</p>

<p>Now, do you want to tell about the shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I have many, many clippings&mdash;as I say, we have all these
people working. And we have come to the conclusion, and have never seen where
they had an autopsy on Patrolman Tippit or even his gun or anything. In other
words, Patrolman Tippit's life has been quiet from the very beginning after
the shooting. I have never seen anything about him in print. And we question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
where all the money that has been given to Mrs. Tippit has come from. That
is a tremendous amount of money&mdash;tremendous for donations.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You say you question the money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; the donations to Mrs. Tippit.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You mean you question whether she received them or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No&mdash;where is the money coming from? As far as she knows,
sir, they are donations. But where is the actual money coming from, because
it is such a large amount? Like I question Marina's money. She has now
$38,000. That is just what they have stated she has. What she has may be
more. But that is a lot of money for donations, a tremendous lot of money.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Tippit has, I think, almost half a million dollars. Is that correct?
I am not quite sure. But, anyhow, it is a large amount of money. And with
our investigation and things that are not according to Hoyle, we do question
where the money is coming from.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you have any idea where it comes from, after your
investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, Mr. Lane has. I do not have all the information. He
has this information. And we are still investigating it, sir. And we will
investigate if it takes another year or two. We are going to continue to arrive
at the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You referred to an article in the Time Magazine of February 14,
1964, volume 83, No. 7, when you said there were some things that were wrong
in it&mdash;do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you write a letter about this assassination of President
Kennedy to President Johnson at some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you send a telegram?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. The only telegram I sent to President Johnson was
stating that I had sent a telegram to you and Chief Justice Warren, if you
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you get any response from the White House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not get a response from the White House. And
I am indignant at the response that I did get. What it did was to inform me,
I was so graciously treated by Mr. Kennedy and his Administration, as I have
stated and testified, that I am shocked that I am now to be told that I am not
to worry the President. "In response to your telegram to the President, I wish
to inform you that any requests or any information dealing with the inquiry
conducted by Chief Justice Warren should properly be directed to the Commission.
I note in your telegram that you have directed your request to the
Chief Justice and to Mr. Rankin, the Commission's General Counsel. Sincerely,
Lee C. White, Assistant Special Counsel to the President."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the response that you received from the White House?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From the telegram that I sent, when I sent a telegram to you
and Chief Justice Warren&mdash;I sent him a telegram. I have it right here, sir.
You don't know about the telegram.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of the telegram.</p>

<p>"President Lyndon B. Johnson. I have sent night letters to Chief Justice
Earl Warren and J. Lee Rankin imploring both in the name of justice and our
American way of life to let my son Lee Harvey Oswald be represented by counsel
so that all witnesses including my son's widow will be cross-examined. Respectfully
yours, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald."</p>

<p>And this is the response to that. And I don't think that is a gracious response
at all. If I want to write the President or send him a telegram, I think I have
as much right as anyone else to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you comment on the fact of this response from the White
House when you received it to anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. There was a reporter from Time Magazine that I
commented to, because I was indignant, as I said. And he said, "Well, if you
or your next door neighbor or anybody walking in the street wanted to write
the President, that is our American way of life." And I agreed with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you are quoted in this article as saying "Why, I have got
as much right as any citizen to write the President of the United States, to
petition him, and let me tell you this, Mr. Johnson should also remember that I
am not just anyone, and that he is only President of the United States by the
grace of my son's action." Is that a correct quote?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, that is not a correct quote. And that is why I was indignant
yesterday when I read that. And there is more discrepancies.</p>

<p>I did tell him about receiving the letter, and I had just received it&mdash;that I
was indignant they should write and as much intimate that I should not write
the President.</p>

<p>I made a special appeal to the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what you did say? Did you say anything like
this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. There was nothing said to this reporter about President
Johnson&mdash;because I believe my son is innocent. So if I say that, then I
would be saying that my son is guilty. And that is why the President is now
the President. No, sir. I did not say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What reporter for Time Magazine was that that you were
talking to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can find out the name for you, or I can think about it. Let's
see. I think the name is Sullivan. I did not want to think&mdash;but I think it is
Sullivan. Do you have that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I will get it for you, or maybe it will come to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But I do know, because I was paid for the picture&mdash;one of the
pictures in that magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We would appreciate your telling us as accurately as you can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I want to give you any and every information I can.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Did the man who interviewed you in this matter also pay
for the picture&mdash;the same man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes sir&mdash;for the Time Magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he pay you for any part of the story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No sir. No, I am wrong there, he did. He paid me for part
of the story. That is not the story.</p>

<p>This isn't the story that was supposed to have come out. It was a much nicer
and softer story. But we have found out that when we give these press
notices, that they don't come out the way you give them. And they explain&mdash;like
if I was to tell Mr. Sullivan, "I am disappointed in your story"&mdash;"Well,
Mrs. Oswald, our editor edits to make room," and so on. That is what you get.
I was disappointed in the story, because the story was that I felt so sorry for
Marina, to think that she had to go through the rest of her life thinking in
her mind that her husband was the killer of President Kennedy, and that she
would have to tell her children that she had gone down in history, that their
father was the killer of President Kennedy. And I went on with a long story.
I said&mdash;they said "Marina had stringy hair, and she didn't have this or that."
Let me tell you, I would rather have Marina with the stringy hair and less
clothes, but thinking that her husband was innocent, like she thought the 3
days I was there&mdash;rather than the picture now, where she smokes, she no longer
nurses her baby, she left her baby in Texas to come to the Warren Commission,
which is not the Marina I know.</p>

<p>"Marina, Mama, no, no, she never left her children." And well groomed.
But she thinks now her husband shot President Kennedy. What an awful thing.
I would much rather have no money and stringy hair and be the girl I was
before, and believe my husband was innocent.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. How much did Life pay you for your story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Is that pertinent?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Or Time, rather.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Is that pertinent to the Commission, or is that my personal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. I don't think the Chief Justice&mdash;he has simply asked you a
question. If you wish to answer the question that is fine. If you don't, if you
tell the Chief Justice you don't wish to answer the <span class="locked">question&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, it doesn't have any bearing. I think the amount I got
would be immaterial to the Commission. I don't know.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well. I think it might be material under some circumstances.
But if she doesn't wish to tell us, that is all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is not&mdash;just like the pictures. I want you to have the
pictures. And you didn't seem to think they were important enough.</p>

<p>I am asking if this is important to the Commission, because that is my personal
life. It is no crime to sell the pictures. I have no job or income. If I
want to sell a picture to a magazine or a newspaper, and protect myself financially,
I am going to continue to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. The Commission has stated to you that it would be interested in
knowing, that it feels it might be of some value to them. But if you do not
wish to say anything about it, they would not press you.</p>

<p>So again, it would be completely up to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think that would probably, like these pictures, be my
<span class="locked">personal&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you learn about the attempt of your son to shoot General
Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am delighted you asked me that question. I have these
notes here, and didn't go through that.</p>

<p>The first time I knew about General Walker was through the paper.</p>

<p>Now, I became indignant. I do not remember the quotes. But why I became
indignant, was that I had Lee's handwriting in Russian. But no one came to
me to find out about this note. That is the part, gentlemen, that is so peculiar
about this whole thing.</p>

<p>I understand through reporters that the note was shown to Mrs. Ruth Paine,
and wanted to know if the handwriting was Lee's handwriting. But no one
has come to find out if I had any handwriting of Lee in Russian, which I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you think this was in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I am under the impression that the note was in Russian.
It stated in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you learn about the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Through the newspaper. And it has been changed, the story,
now. If I can remember. Now, I will get this for you. I have a friend that
has one of the most complete scrapbooks in the United States, that helps in
this investigation. And I can get all these articles, sir. And I will help in
every way possible.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, it was stated that Marina found this note in the
room that says "I may be arrested, and if so get in touch with the Russian
consul" and told her where to go to the jailhouse. I wish I knew the exact
quote. So we are getting back to an agent now.</p>

<p>From what I remember in the beginning, he did not say in the note that he was
going to kill General Walker&mdash;that he would be involved in something that
might cause him to be arrested and so on. I remember this. That was in the
very beginning, sir. It came out in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>So he is going to be involved in something. That doesn't mean he is going
to shoot General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you learn that he did try to shoot General Walker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As the story started to leak out from the paper, what we call
leaks. I have to say this, because we are investigating this. I am not the main
investigator. But I talk to people. They call, and I get letters from them.
Every now and then Mr. Jim Martin, who is the business manager for Marina,
would quote Marina&mdash;not Marina, but he would quote Marina about General
Walker, quoted her about thinking in her mind that her husband had killed the
President.</p>

<p>And I was firing back through the newspapers and saying Mr. Jim Martin was
an American citizen, and I didn't appreciate him quoting my daughter-in-law
about these things, because they are of no advantage. How can they prove
that Lee had killed General Walker, because now maybe they would not have
the bullets&mdash;and so on. It happened before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You knew that he was not killed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What good would it be for Mr. Martin to make a statement like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
this that Marina said, and publicize it, when they possibly could not now prove
that Lee had anything to do with it, gun or bullets or anything. I could not
see his purpose in doing this&mdash;which has hurt my daughter-in-law very much. I
have many letters from people expressing their opinion that they did not appreciate
her coming out with these remarks. But it is Mr. Jim Martin.</p>

<p>Marina is a foreign girl, and doesn't know what these people are doing to
her, Mr. Rankin. I have publicly fought this over and over&mdash;if you have my
quotes from the Fort Worth Star Telegram and so on, and probably the New
York papers. I deeply feel sorry for Marina. Marina is a Russian girl. Maybe
if her husband was picked up to be a murderer, maybe they would shoot him in
Russia. I don't know.</p>

<p>But here we have an American way of life that Marina is not familiar with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Don't you want her to tell the truth about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I want Marina to tell the truth just like I want to tell the
truth. But from my testimony here, I have found out that Marina has lied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What have you found out about the Walker incident? Have you
found anything about that was untrue that Marina said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That Marina said it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have not heard Marina say it. I have not heard Marina say
it. I can answer this way. This comes from Mr. Jim Martin. There is many,
many things about Mr. Jim Martin and Mr. Thorne that I don't think maybe it
is right that I should say these things in front of the Commission, because they
are rumors.</p>

<p>But a rumor, you will have to, in a case as big as this, and where there are so
many people involved, you have to analyze these rumors. I will say this: I
understand from many, many a source that the Dallas Bar Association is going
to have Mr. Jim Thorne before them. Now that is my understanding there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So all you know about the Walker incident is what you have
read in the papers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What I have read in the paper. And I certainly did not appreciate
that. Mr. Jim Martin is a citizen, if Marina is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, did you ever ask your son, Lee Oswald, whether he was
an agent of anybody?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No sir, I have never asked Lee Oswald if he was an agent
because I felt like he would not tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you have not asked him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I have not asked him.</p>

<p>Oh, one very important thing that I must tell you. On November 26&mdash;that
was the night of November 26, and the day of November 26 was when I found out
that Marina was going to live with someone else, and we had no contact. So I
knew I wasn't wanted or involved. I was in the bedroom. And I left the Inn
of the Six Flags, gentlemen, under strict security protection. I opened the
door and had my coat and pocketbook, and I went out doors. And I was about
15 feet when they realized that I had left the Inn. Now, there was a man on
the outside, stationed there night and day. But there was a little arbor. And
this was in the bedroom. We had two entrances&mdash;one to the living room and
one to the bedroom. I opened the bedroom door. I had my coat and bag and
I was going to go home. I was going to take a bus and go home because I
didn't get to talk to my daughter-in-law&mdash;they had taken over.</p>

<p>And I was 15 or 20 feet when two agents came and took me by the arm and I
went back in. I didn't make a stink or anything about it. And that night I
sat up all night, and the next morning I insisted upon going home. But the
point that has to be made is was I under arrest or not&mdash;since these men came
and took me by the arm and brought me back to the Inn of the Six Flags.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Were you all dressed to go home when they took hold of you
that way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, when they took hold of me this way. And I didn't
say anything. I just went back in. So then the doctor&mdash;I do not know his
name, you have his name&mdash;the doctor came in to see the children, they had
diarrhea. And the man whispered something to the doctor. And we closed
the door. The doctor asked me for Lee's social security number. And I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
testified that I had gone home the night before to get all my papers, after much
persuasion. I started to look through the papers for Lee's number. And I
started to cry. He and I were in the room alone. I think this was purposely,
because they said something to the doctor.</p>

<p>I said I am very upset and told the doctor what happened. And I said "You
know, my heart is breaking. I cannot understand how they would do something
like that, and not tell me about it."</p>

<p>So he talked with me, and he gave me two pills. When we opened the door
he said to the agents "She is all right, she has a right to her feelings."
So they must have thought that I was&mdash;something was wrong with me. They
thought&mdash;because I took the attitude immediately&mdash;well, Robert said it&mdash;I
said "Why didn't you let me know." "Well, just because the way you are acting
now." I said "How am I acting. I am acting in a normal way. I have lost my
son. Now you have made arrangements without consulting me to take my
daughter and two grandchildren to live with strangers. This is a normal
reaction. Am I going to say yes, take my daughter-in-law and grandchildren,
I don't need my part of them."</p>

<p>This is a normal reaction.</p>

<p>Reverend Saunders, Louis Saunders, who is a minister at the grave, accidentally
came at the very last minute. He had not preached a sermon in 8
years. He is head of the Council of Churches.</p>

<p>He heard we could not get a minister so he was able to come at the very last
minute. And Rev. Granville Walker was sent to my home in Fort Worth, Tex.,
the next day after I arrived home, to help, to console me about this case. So
he said "Mrs. Oswald, I understand that Marina has been offered a very fine
home, and how do you feel about that. Are you not glad that your daughter-in-law
is going to be taken care of and the children have an education."</p>

<p>I said "No, Reverend Saunders, I do not feel that way about it. Those are
material things. How do we know if these children will live to derive any
benefit from this education. I think that we should stick together as a family.
Her Mama, like she wanted. The girl said she has no Mama. Everything was
arranged for the Mama. She is talking about money and material things. I
expressed my opinion at the Six Flags, that we start with $863&mdash;no contributions
were coming in. And then if we cannot make it, then let the ones that
are so concerned help us. And I remarked&mdash;I am working for a very wealthy
woman.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe she will give us $5,000. Let us stick together as a family.
Reverend Saunders says "Mrs. Oswald, your philosophy of life is beautiful,
and it is a Biblical way. But you know you have to be practical."</p>

<p>So the very next day, sir&mdash;and this is in "Christianity Today," to prove my
point&mdash;Mr. Jim Cox, who writes for "Christianity Today" and is a Star Telegram
reporter called me and said "Mrs. Oswald, Reverend Saunders called me
and wanted me to get a story from you, because he thought you had such a
wonderful philosophy of life."</p>

<p>I sat down, and Mr. Jimmy Cox stayed home from Church&mdash;I gave Mr. Jimmy
Cox a story that is in Christianity Today, that only goes to ministers, and it is
because of Reverend Saunders. So I do have people to testify about this particular
thing. And I did act in a normal way. That is a normal reaction, to
not want to give up my family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald. I will give you Exhibits 206 through 227, both inclusive,
and ask you if that is&mdash;if those are photostatic copies of your correspondence&mdash;would
you look at each one of them&mdash;with the State Department
that you have referred to in your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Do you want the numbers as I go along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. No. You just look at them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. These are copies, Mr. Rankin, of her letters to the State
Department and the responses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes, that is correct, is it not, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And these copies were made under your supervision were they
not.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. And I voluntarily gave you every copy I have.
That is correct. That is correct. That is correct.</p>

<p>Some of this seems to be scratched out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. On Exhibit No. 221, there seems to be some X markings around.
Will you put that aside, and we can compare that with the original.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is correct. That is correct. That is correct. I don't
remember writing to Mrs. James. I remember calling her on the telephone.
This is my handwriting. I guess I did.</p>

<p>Yes, that is my handwriting. That is correct.</p>

<p>That is correct. That is correct. And this is correct, but should have a
card with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. You are referring to 227?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. And it should have with it a card, a postcard, from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Set 227 aside with 221.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you have a copy of 221?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you please check to see that is a correct copy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that we might gain time now if we would check these
exhibits out with Mrs. Oswald, and be able to offer them at whatever time we
reconvene. That is all we propose to do now.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the card that should have gone with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, were you able to find your copy of Exhibit 221,
and compare it and see whether that which is marked on is on your copy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No sir, we have not found that yet.</p>

<p>"Yours 11th" is scratched out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So that 221 is correct, but apparently there are some <span class="locked">errors&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There are more errors, too. Because it doesn't say "Services
Department of State."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. 221 does not appear to be a photostat of the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But it does have exactly the same material on it, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It doesn't have this&mdash;"collect." I would not say it was an
exact copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. It appears to have substantially the information on it. It is not
a photostat of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I might advise you, Mrs. Oswald, this is from the State Department's
file, from which the telegram was made up that was sent to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. It is not a photostat, but it does have substantially the information
that is set forth in the telegram itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, you have examined all of the exhibits, 206 through 227,
both inclusive, and found them, except for what you and your counsel said
about exhibit 221, and the card that was with 227, to be correct.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibits 206 through 227, both inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibit Nos. 206 through 227, heretofore marked for identification,
were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is the card that goes with this letter, as an explanation.</p>

<p>(The card referred to was marked Exhibit No. 240 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 240 is the card you have just referred to that goes with
Exhibit 227, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 240, and ask that a copy be
substituted.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The card referred to was received in evidence as Commission Exhibit
No. 240.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, would you examine exhibits 228 through 236, both
inclusive? And tell us whether or not those appear to be photostatic copies
of correspondence about the Albert Schweitzer College and application?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is right. That is right. This is correct. That is
right. That is right. That is right. That is right. That is right. That is
right. That is right. That is right. That is right.</p>

<p>Those are all right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have just finished comparing Exhibits 228 through 236
both inclusive, and found them to be correct photostatic copies of your files
concerning the Albert Schweitzer matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence, Exhibits 228 through 236 both inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The photostatic copies referred to were received in evidence as Commission
Exhibit Nos. 228 through 236, inclusive.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Have you introduced all the records you have now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Just a few more, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked 241 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I hand you Exhibit 241 and ask you if that is one
of the letters that you referred to in your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And it is one that you received?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is one that I received in a letter from Russia, from Lee.
And you have the letter, telling me to go to the International Rescue Committee,
and to show the papers to the Red Cross in Vernon. This is the letter inclosed
in that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibit 241, and ask leave to substitute
a copy.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The letter referred to was received in evidence as Commission Exhibit
No. 241.)</p>

<p>(Documents marked 242 and 243 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibits 242 and 243 are the telegram and the letter you
received back from your transmission to the White House that you have
testified about this morning, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you say you would like to have the originals back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We offer in evidence Exhibits 242 and 243 and ask leave to
substitute copies.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted on that condition.</p>

<p>(Commission Exhibits Nos. 242 and 243 were admitted in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Are all the records identified now and admitted, Mr.
Rankin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, we have one further matter, and that is
some correspondence that involves her son's communications with the Embassy,
which correspondence was examined in the presence of Mr. Mark Lane
when we were taking photostatic copies. And during that examination, Mrs.
Oswald was able to identify the handwriting on part of them, and not able
to identify it on another part. Is that right, Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And we think we should probably, to cover that matter, ask
her briefly to point those out.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well. Let's get that done before we adjourn, and
then we will adjourn for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Reporter, I will ask you to mark these exhibits, which
are the ones that I understand Mrs. Oswald was able to identify the handwriting
on.</p>

<p>(Documents were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 244 through 250 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, will you examine Exhibits 244 through 250,
both inclusive, and tell us whether or not those are photostatic copies of
communications of your son that you recognize the handwriting on of the
originals?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. If you do not on any one of them, announce the number.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is one I would believe that I have stated&mdash;if he wrote
it, he wrote it very careful. It is not scribbled like he usually does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. That is 246.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell whether or not that is his signature on the
second page of Exhibit 246?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is just a little different. That could be forged. Just a
little difference. We write left handed, and we have a trend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is that one that you said before that you thought you could
recognize?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't know, sir. I have no way of knowing. How would
I know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As I have stated before, when I am looking at it, it doesn't
appear to be immediately as Lee's handwriting. But it could be something that
he has recopied over and over to get such a perfect lettering. It is not
scribbled like we usually scribble. Now, this was one also that I would
<span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 247.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is scribbled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is more scribbled, you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is not quite as his ordinary writing. It is a little more
thoughtfully written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think it is his, though?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say this is his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, this is thoughtfully written, too, yet it is his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 248.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am looking at this handwriting, because the rest of it is
printed. I do not know too much about Lee's printing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell about the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The signature looks like Lee's signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will state again this looks like Lee's handwriting, but very
thoughtfully written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 249. Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right. And this is Lee's signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 250 that you just referred to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Now, I would say it is all Lee's handwriting, but
very thoughtfully written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you. We offer in evidence Exhibits 244 through 250,
both inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were received in evidence as Commission
Exhibits Nos. 244 through 250, inclusive.)</p>

<p>(A group of documents was then marked 251 through 258 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I will hand you Exhibits 251 through 257, both
inclusive, and ask you to examine those, and state whether you recognize
the handwriting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That doesn't look too much like Lee's handwriting. It could
be a finer pen and more thoughtfully written. But I cannot identify this as
Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell about the signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The signature looks a little like Lee's signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. You refer to 251, when you are discussing this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, 251.</p>

<p>Now, this one I would say was not Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is 252?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 252.</p>

<p>I have never known Lee to sign Lee Harvey Oswald. He always signed
Lee H. There again, that could be Lee's handwriting with a fine pen. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
very thoughtfully written. But I will say it is not Lee's. I don't think it
is. I cannot be positive. But I do not think it is Lee's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 252 that you have been referring to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Exhibit 252.</p>

<p>Here is another of the same caliber. It is too perfect. The writing
is too perfect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What about the signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The signature looks like Lee's signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. That is 253.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 253. Yes, sir. This is a little different signature, I would
say, than his normal signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 254?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 254, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that Exhibit 254 is your son's handwriting or
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would have to say with reservations again. It would
have to be rewritten very thoroughly. It is not scribbled enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that those letters, 251 through 254, are too carefully
done for your son Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And if he did do them, he would have to have four
or five copies to do it so perfect.</p>

<p>This is a little more scribbled. This signature looks more like Lee's
than the other did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is 255?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. 255.</p>

<p>This looks like Lee's handwriting&mdash;a lot of misspelling, and his signature.
256.</p>

<p>Now his Russian handwriting I know only from return addresses. However,
I do have two brown papers with Russian writing on, from gifts that
were sent to me. But I don't know if Lee addressed them or not.</p>

<p>And this is Lee's handwriting with a very fine pen. Isn't this handwriting
backwards for a left hand? It seems when I looked at "my," it should
be going this way&mdash;because I write like Lee, left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you refer to this&mdash;or asked whether it was backwards,
you were referring to Exhibit 257, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. This "m" should be going this way&mdash;which it is really.
But it is kind of hard to testify to. I would say this is Lee's handwriting
with a very fine pen, with reservations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Exhibit 257.</p>

<p>We offer in evidence Exhibits 251 through 257, both inclusive.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were received in evidence as Commission
Exhibits Nos. 251 through 257, inclusive.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, are you now ready&mdash;we are not going to
ask you to do it right now, but we are going to recess at 2 o'clock. But
are we now at the point where we can hear whatever you want to tell us
about your life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry, but I would like to have lunch.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I said that we were going to have lunch. But when we
return&mdash;you have things up to that point of your story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>You have another question you want to ask before we recess for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I should like to offer for the limited purpose, Mr. Chairman, of
the fact that we presented this picture to Mrs. Oswald and she said
it was not the picture that was presented to her&mdash;for that limited purpose
I should like to offer Exhibit 237.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be so admitted.</p>

<p>(The picture referred to was received in evidence as Commission Exhibit
No. 237.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, during the noon hour may I have the custody
of this transcript of a tape recording of an interview with Mrs. Oswald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
the 28 pages which was tendered to us by Mr. Rankin this morning&mdash;and
I will return it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is for them to have.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is to become your own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. To become the property of Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. The property of Mrs. Oswald, yes. That is what we gave
it to you for. She requested that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well, we will recess now until 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARGUERITE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:05 p.m.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right, Mr. Rankin, will you proceed with the hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you said that you would like to turn now to telling
us about your life. We would appreciate that if you would do that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, if you would prefer not to tell the story of your
life, that is perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I want to tell the story but there is something else that upsets me.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It is perfectly all right if you don't wish to. You may take
your time now and go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry, you will have to excuse me about the story of my
life, and Mr. Doyle knows why, but there is one part of the story of my life that
will have a great connection with this, I believe.</p>

<p>I married Mr. Edwin Ekdahl who was an electrical engineer and a $10,000 a
year man with an expense account. Mr. Ekdahl had a woman before he married
me. Of course, I didn't know about it, sir. I made him wait a year before I
married him, but the way I found this out, I received a telephone call, a telegram
rather, he traveled&mdash;lots of times Lee and I traveled with him&mdash;stating he
wouldn't return home when he was supposed to and for me not to meet him.</p>

<p>So, I called his office, I was familiar with, knew his secretary, and I was
going to tell her that Mr. Ekdahl would be delayed 3 or 4 days. But immediately
she said, "Mrs. Ekdahl, Mr. Ekdahl is not in, he has gone out to lunch."</p>

<p>So, I said, the general conversation went "When will he be back" and so on,
and so that evening I took the car and I went to the Texas Electric Co., works
for the Texaco, the main office in New York, but he was working in Fort Worth
at the time, went to the building and saw him leave the building and I followed
him and to an apartment house, saw him go into this apartment house.</p>

<p>Then I went back home, and my oldest son, John Edward Pic, who is in the
service, had a friend at the house who was about 2 years older. I told them
about what happened. So it was night by this time. The kids went with me.</p>

<p>I called Mr. John McClain, who is an attorney, and we live next door to Mr.
McClain, and told him that I had seen Mr. Ekdahl go into a home when he was
supposed to be out of town and what should I do.</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Oswald, just ring the phone. Do you know the woman?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Just ring the phone and let him know that you know he is there, that you saw
him."</p>

<p>After I thought about it I thought that is not a good idea because he could
leave and say he was just there on business and I wanted to catch him there.</p>

<p>So the kids and I planned that we would say she had a telegram, so we went
up the stairs, I believe it was the second or the third floor, and the young man
knocked on the door and said, "Telegram for Mrs. Clary"&mdash;was her name.</p>

<p>She said, "Please push it under the door" and I told him no; he said, "No,
you have to sign for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
So with that she opened the door to sign for it and with that I, my son, and with
the other young man walked into the room and Mrs. Clary had on a negligee,
and my husband had his sleeves rolled up and his tie off sitting on a sofa, and
he said, "Marguerite, Marguerite, you have everything wrong, you have everything
wrong."</p>

<p>He says, "Listen to me."</p>

<p>I said, "I don't want to hear one thing. I have seen everything I want to see,
this is it."</p>

<p>My two boys, in military school, the two older boys, I am paying for the two
older boys because I have sold a piece of property. I wanted to take care as
long as I had money of my own children and when I married Mr. Ekdahl if he
would support me and Lee I would be able to take care of John Edward, and
Robert in military school, we couldn't have them with us because Mr. Ekdahl
traveled.</p>

<p>This man never let me share with his insurance policies, beneficiary, in other
words, I was another woman to him. I received $100 a month and that was it.
That was all the money I had from Mr. Ekdahl, and when we traveled, for instance,
we were in Santa Fe, N. Mex., and he was with all the businessmen,
we would have to wait until Mr. Ekdahl got through, the baby and I, in order
to eat, whether it was 2 or 3 o'clock in the evening because here I was, registered
under Mrs. Ekdahl and I had a checking account, but under the name of
Oswald, which was the money I was using for the children so it was kind of
inconvenient for me to write a check under the name of Oswald.</p>

<p>I am trying to point out the kind of man he was.</p>

<p>I had a nice living in this sense. We lived in the finest hotels and we had
the finest food because all of this was charged to his expense account but he
gave me nothing but this $100. That was a standard thing and he expected me
to account for every cent of the hundred dollars that I spent, which I refused
to do.</p>

<p>So, we argued naturally, because this is not a marriage. Any man who marries
a woman naturally shares, she shares in his bank account and in his insurance
and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>I wanted to divorce Mr. Ekdahl naturally but my two boys as I have stated
before were in the military school, and I wanted to wait until the end of the
season, the school season.</p>

<p>So, Lee and I went to Covington, La., and I picked the boys up at military
school because this was summer time&mdash;rather I wasn't back to him.</p>

<p>I left him and went back to him. But this particular time I picked the boys
up at military school and we spent the summer in Covington, La., and by the
way, I forgot to say that Lee had a beautiful voice and sang beautifully at age 6
in Covington, La., he sang a solo in the church, Silent Night, and that can be
verified. This is a very small town and the only Lutheran Church there.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Ekdahl came to Covington, La., and I went back again to Mr. Ekdahl.
But this time I went back to him I hadn't found out about the woman. I got
excited. Then I found out about the woman, he rented a place on 8th Avenue,
a home.</p>

<p>And after I was there about a day I was in the yard hanging out some things
and it was in the apartment house downstairs and a woman came along and I
said, "How are you? I am Mrs. Ekdahl."</p>

<p>She looked astonished, and after I had made friends with her she informed
me Mr. Ekdahl had a woman in this particular house while I was in Covington
and she thought she was his wife but now I am the wife come.</p>

<p>Then I found out about the woman and we went to her apartment and caught
her there. This is the end of the season by this time.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Ekdahl filed suit for divorce from me. I thought I was
sitting pretty. He didn't have anything on me. I had him for adultery with witnesses
and everything and I didn't have an idea that he could sue me for a
divorce, but Mr. Ekdahl did sue me for a divorce, and Mr. Ekdahl got the
divorce. It was a jury case, and Mr. John McClain, was my attorney, the man
I told you that I called to find out what to do.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Fred Korth represented Mr. Ekdahl and when I walked into the
courtroom, gentlemen, there were witnesses there that I had never seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
A Mr. George Levine, who is a very big businessman and who Mr. Ekdahl was
representing in Fort Worth for the electrical part of his plant. I knew him this
way.</p>

<p>One time we went to the circus with his wife, my husband, myself and Lee,
before going to the circus we had dinner. Now, understand we are having dinner
in a public place. From the dinner we go to the circus, we are in a public
place and I want you to know that it is the only time I had seen Mr. George
Levine, when Mr. George Levine rushed from work in his khaki pants and got
on the witness stand swore how I nagged Mr. Ekdahl and how I threw bottles at
him and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>There were other witnesses that I had never seen, sir, who swore how I nagged
Mr. Ekdahl, and Mr. Ekdahl got his divorce from me.</p>

<p>Now, 2 days after the assassination, after Lee's death, while I am at Six Flags
it comes over the radio that Mr. Korth knew the family, this happened in 1948,
sir, then Mr. Korth knew the family, and that he had represented Mr. Ekdahl
in divorce proceedings and, of course, talked to the reporters where they got
the information that I hit him with a bottle and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Now, that is my story there. I am not even guilty of that divorce, as you see.
This can be proved by my son John Edward Pic because he was a witness, sir.</p>

<p>I do not think I am going&mdash;I am not going to speculate but give my thoughts to
anyone who would immediately make a statement that he had represented the
mother of the accused assassin as an attorney years ago, and that I nagged Mr.
Ekdahl and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>That was publicly announced about 2 days after my son was shot, sir.</p>

<p>Now, the name then, of course, he probably knew the name Oswald, but the
name then was Ekdahl that I would say would stick in his mind more.</p>

<p>I will try to get to the very beginning of my life, Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Any time. Just take your time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother died when I was quite young and my father raised
us with housekeepers. My aunt lived in the neighborhood and I had a lot of
cousins and a lot of aunts. My father was French, his name was Claverie, and
my mother was German, the name is Stucke. All of my father's folks spoke
French and my father spoke French to his sisters. I was a child of one parent,
and yet I have had a normal life, a very hard normal life that I had been able
to combat all by myself, sir, without much help from anyone.</p>

<p>I am saying that in reference to Lee being alone; there have been so many
psychiatrists saying he was by himself and he had a father image and that is
why he did the shooting. There are many, many children with one parent who
are perfectly normal children and I happen to be one myself.</p>

<p>I had a very happy childhood. I sang. I sang from the kindergarten at grammar
school, and all through grammar school I was the lead singer. I was one
of the most popular young ladies in the school. I also play piano by ear. I
don't know a note. I used to play the marching school song for the school
children.</p>

<p>At my grammar school graduation I had the honor of wearing a pink dress
instead of a white dress and sang the song "Little Pink Roses." So I had a very
happy childhood and a very full childhood. I played the piano. We had house
parties in those days and a lot of gatherings and it was everything Marguerite&mdash;and
I also played a ukulele, so I have a very full happy childhood.</p>

<p>At the age of 17, I am ahead of my story&mdash;I have had 1 year high school education.
I know that on my applications I had that I had completed high school
but that is almost necessary to get a job.</p>

<p>But I had 1 year of high school education is all that I had, sir.</p>

<p>I then went to work at age 17, not quite 17, for one of the biggest corporation
lawyers in New Orleans, La. The name then was DuFour, Rosen, Wolff, and
Kammer. Mr. DuFour died while I was there and Mr. Kammer, I believe, is
still living but they were corporation attorneys for that firm plus 4 or 5 other
attorneys that handled divorce cases and similar cases and I was receptionist
in the outer office.</p>

<p>So, everybody who came into the office had to state their business to me, because
the attorneys were very busy, and if it was a particular case I had to
know who to refer the party to this particular man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
So, naturally, I got a very large education, let's say, by doing this, and
the mayor and everybody in the town, these are the largest attorneys, corporation
attorneys in New Orleans, sir, and they were attorneys representing the
New Orleans Public Service and big things of that sort, and the mayor and all
used to call me the boss. When the mayor came in he had an appointment but
I still had to ring the phone to see if the men were ready to see him. So they
called me the boss.</p>

<p>I was also a maid in one of the carnival balls. I am a very poor young lady
but a very, let's say, popular young lady.</p>

<p>My early childhood. We lived on the Phillips Street in New Orleans which
was a very poor neighborhood. My father was one of the very first streetcar
conductors and stayed on the very same line all these years until he retired
and they gave him a citation because he was on the same line all those years from
retirement, and we lived in a mixed neighborhood of Negroes and white, and my
childhood I played with Negroes, sir, right next door to me was a lovely family
that I grew up with this Negro family.</p>

<p>I married Mr. Edward John Pic, Jr., while working at the law firm. I was
married to Mr. Pic two and a half years when I became with child, and he did
not want any children. His family and my family tried to talk to him, and, well,
his family almost beat him up to say, but nobody could do anything with him.</p>

<p>So, at 3 months I left Mr. Pic. Mr. Pic did not divorce me, and you have
the records there of me divorcing Mr. Pic, contrary to all other stories, sir.</p>

<p>This child, John Edward Pic then I bore alone, without a husband. I was
3 months pregnant. I had 6 more months to go, and I had this child without a
husband.</p>

<p>So, I have had two children without a husband present, Lee and the first
child.</p>

<p>Mr. Oswald was an insurance agent, and he used to collect insurance at my
sister's house, and the day that I left Mr. Pic he helped move my furniture,
the things that I was going to take.</p>

<p>I didn't see Mr. Ekdahl for some time <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Ekdahl or Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Oswald, sir, I am sorry.</p>

<p>John Edward and I were coming from the park one day, and Mr. Ekdahl
picked&mdash;Mr. Oswald picked me up, and he was separated from his wife, however,
not divorced but had been separated for a number of years, and I started dating
Mr. Ekdahl and we decided to marry and he divorced his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You said Ekdahl again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oswald, I am sorry, and then he got the divorce proceeding.
He was separated for a long time but never had been divorced from his wife but
when we knew he was going to marry, and I also then got the divorce from Mr.
Pic. I was not divorced there from Mr. Pic, either. We were legally separated
but I was not divorced from him.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Oswald and I married and of that marriage Robert was born 9 months
later, and as you know consequently Lee, 2 months after his father had died.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Oswald was a very good man. There was the only happy part of my
life. When he died hardly anybody knew that John Edward Pic was not his
son. He wanted to adopt John Edward, but because his father was supporting
him which I think was only $18 a month, I explained to Lee that I thought we
should save this money for the boys' education and let his own father support
him and naturally we would educate and do all we could do but that was no
more than right. So that is why he did not adopt John Edward.</p>

<p>Now, that is the story of my three marriages. I have been married approximately
9 years in the three times that I have been married, sir, and I would
say, I am probably guilty of a lot of things but the initial guilt has never been
mine in any of these marriages, the first marriage I had explained, the second
marriage was death, and the third marriage was Mr. Ekdahl.</p>

<p>I think then you know the rest of the story, how I lived with my children
and tried to support my children.</p>

<p>I have often held two jobs trying to support my children. I have a whole
file that the Commission has copies of jobs that I have worked, and I have also
worked for these places twice, and have gone back. I have wonderful recommendations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
I think I have been fired about five times in my life, and I have
had much, much employment, and the reason for that is finances, in other words,
I have always had a very low salary, and I am a very aggressive sales person,
as these papers say, and I always produce for my people and I was in demand
actually.</p>

<p>They would come to me and offer me 20, 25 dollars more, believe me, gentlemen.
I would quit the job where I was and quit the new job because 25 dollars paid
my light and heat bill and gave my children some clothes and that is mostly
the reason for all of this employment, and also I used to quit my job as much
as possible in the summer time when the children were little in order to be
home with them.</p>

<p>Now, I skipped a part in the beginning about the children being placed in
the Lutheran Home. I am Lutheran and I was a church member, a church
worker, I should say. I helped, I sewed, natural gifted, I never did take a
lesson, I never did use a pattern, my sister can verify this.</p>

<p>I used to come home from the attorneys with material, cut out the material,
sew it, press it and go out on a date. I just had the knack of doing things that
way, sir, and she can verify this because my niece, I taught her to sew and
my sister said, "You are so slow, Aunt Marguerite used to sew on the material
and go out on a date," and my niece would say, "Is it true, my mother said
you would sew on material and go out on a date," and I said, "I wish I had a
nickel for every time I did."</p>

<p>So those are gifted things I can't explain.</p>

<p>Lee had certain gifted ways about him also.</p>

<p>In the early part of my life that I had skipped when the war broke out and
my finances were gone, I talked with the church. It was on Alva Street in
New Orleans, not too far where my home was and they investigated the money
I had, and I had a little money left at this time and they let me place the two
older boys in the Lutheran Home which is a home only for the Lutheran Church.</p>

<p>This is not an institution. They have their own private school on the ground,
and it is primarily based for children of one parent. However, they do take
orphans. It was really not designed to be an orphan home. It was for children
of one parent and you pay according to your circumstances, and they investigated
my salary and after I went to work, I paid according to my circumstances
for my two boys.</p>

<p>I took my two boys home with me every weekend, sir, and brought them back
in time for Sunday so they can go to church with the children in the home.
They got a wonderful education because the school on the school grounds had
very few children in them.</p>

<p>There would be maybe two or three children to a particular grade so they
had wonderful school. Lee was too young. They would not take Lee into the
home until he was 3 years old.</p>

<p>So, I have hired maids and I have quit many a job for this. You have a
background on my job, this accounts for it. Many a position and I have always
had title and no money, assistant manager or manager in charge of a department,
and I have had to quit that, because the maid wouldn't show up, and
you couldn't get a maid for love or money.</p>

<p>War had broken out and the Negroes in New Orleans were going into factories
and so on and so forth so there is many a job I had to leave in order to stay
home and mind Lee until I could get help.</p>

<p>Then my sister helped with Lee. There is one particular instance, I let a
couple have my home, plus $15 a month in order to care for Lee while I worked,
and this couple after about 2 month's time had neglected Lee and so I had to
put them out of the house and there again I had to quit a job, and take care of
Lee until I could make arrangements and my sister could help me with it.</p>

<p>So when Lee was 3 years old I was having it very difficult with Lee, because
of the different people to take care of Lee, and the different jobs that I had
to give up.</p>

<p>However, I was never in want of work. It was during the war and I was
always able to get work, but I realized if I continued to quit jobs because I
couldn't hold the jobs that some day I wouldn't have enough jobs in New
Orleans for me to hold one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
So, then at age 3 Lee was placed in the home. I waited patiently for age 3
because I wanted naturally for the brothers to be together. It was hard on
Lee also because Lee was at a different place and his brothers were at a
different place. So at age 3 I placed Lee in a Lutheran home. Of course, you
have to be under strict investigation financially and otherwise to do this
because this is a church placement, sir.</p>

<p>Then, I became manager of Princess hosiery shop on Canal Street. I opened
that shop and I was left by myself and in 6 days' time I hired four girls.
There was the first shop this man has had. He now has, I think, 54 stores and
he always remembers me as on the road of starting him to success, because this
young man didn't have much money at the time. And this is where I met
Mr. Ekdahl and there is why I didn't want to marry right away because the
children were being taken care of and I was manager of the hosiery shop.</p>

<p>So, now, I was sitting pretty in our American slang and I did not want to
marry. But he persisted. He decided he wanted to marry me and I decided
to marry him. I went to the Lutheran home and talked to the, well, you don't
call him a manager, the head of the home, and I was going to marry Mr. Ekdahl,
and I asked if I should have, if I could have Lee, that I didn't want the children,
John Edward, and Robert to miss their schooling and I told them that I would
wait until the children got out of school to marry Mr. Ekdahl but Mr. Ekdahl
traveled, and, yet, he had a stroke and Mr. Ekdahl had offered, if I would
come to Dallas, he was being transferred to Dallas, that he would pay my room,
my living quarters and everything if I would cook and take care of him and
I told the home, the Lutheran home about this arrangement, so there was
nothing going to be immoral about it, sir, or I wouldn't have explained to the
Lutheran home and they let me have Lee under those circumstances because
they knew that I was a good woman and doing the best I could.</p>

<p>So, I got Lee, and when we went to Dallas, I then realized I did not want
to marry Mr. Ekdahl, but I had already given up my position as manager of
the hosiery shop, and had taken Lee out of school so with the money, I told
you I had some money, and I had sold a piece of property, I bought another
piece of property for a very small down payment on Victor Street in Dallas,
Tex., and Mr. Ekdahl traveled.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Ekdahl used to come on weekends and stay at my home. Of course,
in his bedroom with my children, just maybe not even every weekend because he
traveled, and then I decided I would marry Mr. Ekdahl. I mean I decided not to,
I mean, he was a persistent one.</p>

<p>Then I married Mr. Ekdahl and the home was sold and I traveled with Mr.
Ekdahl and the children were put into military school with the money I sold
the home with.</p>

<p>I believe I have covered everything. I am not quite sure.</p>

<p>Are there any questions, Mr. Rankin, that I haven't gotten?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I think that is very helpful.</p>

<p>I would like to ask you about those pictures that you offered and then decided
you didn't want to give us. If you would get those out, I would like to
identify them so that there cannot be any misunderstanding about just what they
are about.</p>

<p>Could you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By the way, one of the reporters when I came downstairs said
"What is all the commotion about those pictures, you have, Mrs. Oswald?"
Where do those leaks come from? That is the example. They wanted to know
about the pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. Chief Justice, this is Lee at 6 months.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. He was a good looking baby.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is Lee there at 2 years. Would&mdash;if you would like a copy
of the Marina pictures, sir, I would be more than happy to do that.</p>

<p>I think they are in an envelope. This is important, Mr. Rankin. This has
something to do with Time Magazine is what I think he did. This is where he
got that from. These were copied for this session. These are from my other
boys to mother, and John Edward and which I wanted to show we were a family
but as soon as the boys married&mdash;here is another thing, which is true to human
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
I am a widow woman with no money and I happened not to have the type
daughter-in-laws who wanted a widow woman in case they have to support me.
My children make very low salaries and so I am not alone, we have thousands
and thousands of women like me. It is hard to say the children don't want you.
But there are many, many mothers whose sons have married because it is
different with a girl.</p>

<p>Now a girl will take care of the mother but the boy's mother is usually nothing
and I am not going to be helped or supported.</p>

<p>I am going to take care of myself because that is the attitude and that was
the attitude when I was sick.</p>

<p>Lee Harvey Oswald was the only one who has helped his mother at any time
but I wanted to show mothers today cared and everything until they married.
That was the type family we were, sir.</p>

<p>And this was the picture, Mr. Rankin, of the three children which is a happy
life and he wanted to be in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I am going to call your attention to Exhibit 258
which you just referred to and said maybe that is what you meant.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, because I gave him this when he entered the home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This Exhibit 258 refers to the letter you received from me as
general counsel for the Commission, and then a letter to the President, and your
appeal to the President, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And this is a copy you released for the press conference in
Dallas. That is Exhibit 258. I offer Exhibit 258.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It may be admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. If you will permit me, I will ask the court reporter to identify
these pictures and I don't intend to offer them but then I will ask you each one
by number so we can make it clear, and then return them to you, so you can
tell us what they are about, is that all right with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is just fine, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, Mrs. Oswald, I will hand you Exhibits 259 through 269,
both inclusive, and ask you to take them starting with Exhibit 259 and referring
to the exhibit in each case, tell the Commission what the picture is about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 259 is of the three children, John Edward, Robert, and Lee and
the three are smiling. In fact this picture was in a magazine because of the
three good poses. It is hard to get three pictures alike.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About how old are the children in that picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I know Lee was approximately going on 6 years old. There is
5 years difference in Robert so Robert would be 11, that is correct and John
Edward would be 13. That is when they went to military school.</p>

<p>This is a picture of Lee at age 6 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You are talking about Exhibit 260?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 260, yes, sir.</p>

<p>This is a picture of Lee at the Bronx Zoo, Exhibit 261 at age 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the Bronx Zoo in New York?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is the Bronx Zoo in New York that you told us about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>262 is a picture of Lee in Atsugi, Japan in 1958 showing his strength.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That shows him in Marine uniform also, does it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In his Marine uniform showing his muscles to his mother.</p>

<p>And this is a picture, Exhibit 263 taken in Corregidor 1957 in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. He is still in the Marines there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Oh, yes, he is in fatigues, there. This is a picture taken August
19, 264 taken in California coming home on leave from Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. 264 he is still in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he is still in the Marines August 19. This is a picture of
Lee taken in Minsk, Russia June 1st, 1961, Minsk, USSR, Exhibit 267.</p>

<p>There is a picture of Marguerite Oswald, the mother taken in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What is the number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 265.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you. That is your own picture?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>This is a Mother's Day card sent to me from Santa Ana, California on May 7,
1959 from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is Exhibit 266?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And this is Exhibit 268 which is a Christmas card I had sent
Lee on his first Christmas away from home&mdash;he joined in October&mdash;that Lee had
kept all these years in his sea bag, this was found in his sea bag he left with me.</p>

<p>This is a book of Christmas carols Exhibit 269 that was also found in Lee's
sea bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, Exhibits 259 to 269 both inclusive, are those all of the
pictures that you were offering the Commission this morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have many more pictures, I would be happy to show you but
these are the pictures that your Mr. Jenner said he would like to have for the
Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And that you were referring to when you offered them to the
Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you very much and we would like to return them to you
at this time.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. We will return them to you, Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The Chairman. Well I think that will be all then. Thank you Mrs. Oswald
and if you become too tired with your testimony, we know it has been a long
and arduous task for you, but we appreciate your presence.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Doyle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Sorry for the interruption, sir. Mrs. Oswald, do you care to make
any comment to the Commission about the tape recording, the transcript of the
tape recording of Mrs. Marguerite Oswald furnished to you by the Commission
this morning? Do you care to make any comment about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Should I go all the way and make the comment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. You make any comment you desire on that paper. I ask you
whether or not you have any comment to make concerning that paper that you
sent, that you were given?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am concerned about one thing, Mr. Doyle, if I may just step
over there and ask you a question.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may step out in the hall and talk to Mr. Doyle.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Chief Justice Warren and Mr. Rankin, I have read this and
it has upset me very, very much, that is what I was upset about. I have stated
before in my testimony that at the end of the Six Flags I insisted upon going
home and getting my important papers and I was ignored.</p>

<p>I wanted to testify. They put Robert on tape many a time and Marina continuously
and I didn't have an interview. I have stated this previously, if you
remember, and then finally a Mr. Howard put me on tape for about 5 or 10
minutes only, sir, and I had started with the defection because I was under
the impression that we missed a bet when we didn't find out how Lee got to
Russia and as far as I know, no reporter has been able to find out what ship he
left on, and then Robert left the bedroom because he had the news that we
could not get a minister, if you recall, and cried, and I said to Mr. Howard
"Now all that I have left me because I see my son crying bitterly." I have stated
these facts before, a very short interview.</p>

<p>This interview is supposed to have been by Mr. Howard, sir. The same Mr.
Mike Howard that I have previously identified before on many occasions, and
I swear before this Committee that now my life is more in danger which I have
said before, because I did not give this testimony. This is the testimony that
has been gathered by known facts because I have been a public figure.</p>

<p>I have had three press conferences, I have written for magazines and newspapers.
I have not kept quiet, sir, as you know, so these things have been
accumulated. I was not questioned and answered, sir. I have stated it before
and I state it now. This is the same man who was sent to me in Fort Worth,
Tex. that I have complained that I did not get protection, if you will recall.
This is the very same man, sir. This is the same man that I have told you
that gave my daughter-in-law a red-carpet treatment if you will recall along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
with the other one I identified in the picture. This is the man I have been
sitting here complaining about. Here is my evidence. I am ready to have
a heart attack. I was sick, sir, when I read it because I realize now how my
life is in danger and I want to say this: Many people know about this, many
people, sir, Mr. Jack Langdon of the Morning Times, Mr. Blair Justice of the
Star Telegram and I immediately called Mr. Blair Justice of the Star Telegram
when this man knocked on my door last week to protect me, and told
Blair Justice that this was the man, there was an article written in the Star
Telegram, not printed but about pointed every lie at the Six Flags I made it
plain that the other one if he had a gun would have shot me in my prior testimony,
Mr. Rankin you remember that, so I told Mr. Justice, I said "Justice
I am scared to death. This is the same man that I am suspicious of that they
have now sent to guard me," and as you know, sir, I was not protected.</p>

<p>I was not protected while in Fort Worth. I have testified to that, if you
will recall. This is the man, and I did not give this testimony, sir.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly stated to newspapermen and to everybody publicly that I
have never been questioned. The only thing I could figure why I was never
questioned is because Lee was an agent, and I have stated that fact. Why
they left me alone, because I have never been questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Tom Whalen who is an announcer for one of the television stations in
Fort Worth he kept calling Lee the assassin of President Kennedy, and I
called Mr. Whalen and I said to Mr. Whalen "You don't know that Lee
assassinated President Kennedy. I object to that."</p>

<p>I said "I can't tell you what to do, sir, but I would like you to say the
accused assassin because this is what he is" and he apologized and we talked
a little while and I said no sir, I told him I was not&mdash;I had never been interviewed.
He says "I can't believe that, Mrs. Oswald." I said "Believe it or
not I have never been interviewed," which I made a statement upon arriving
in Washington that I have never had a complete tape recording or question
and answer.</p>

<p>I went to the courthouse, and gave my information to the FBI men as I
stated previously, which took a few minutes.</p>

<p>I never did see those men after that. They weren't investigated and at the
Six Flags I repeatedly wanted to go home and get my papers and give the
documents that I have here, as I stated, and I was not questioned, sir at Six
Flags.</p>

<p>I was questioned for about 5 or 10 minutes and I stopped this way. All
of my thoughts have gone from me because I see my son crying. I have
previously stated that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, in light of your saying that you didn't give this
interview evidenced by this document, a copy of which we gave to you which
purports to have been recorded on November 25, 1963, by Mr. Howard, I would
like to have that identified by the reporter and then give you another copy
that you can compare, and I would like to ask you just a few questions about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I hand you back the 28-page reported interview
that I just referred to that has just been marked Exhibit 270 and ask you if
that is the document that you were referring to in your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; this is the document I am referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That you just said you did not give that interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. And I will finish something, too, Mr. Mark R.
Lane called and I told Mr. Mark Lane about the Secret Service man. He knows
about this, many know about this, I have witnesses by this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What do you mean by this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About this man, Mr. Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I see. But not that you said that you did not give this
interview.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you say this, you didn't mean that they know that you
did not give this interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. They knew that I didn't testify, I am sorry. But Mr.
Mark Lane called me the morning that I was to&mdash;the day I was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
leave Fort Worth to come to Washington, sir, and I said to Mr. Mark Lane,
"I am not going in the car with Mr. Mike Howard." and there was another
Mr. Howard by the way who came there that day. I don't know whether he
was his brother or not, we will have to find out, sir, the day I was going to
leave for Washington, and I said, "Lane, I am scared to death." He says
"Don't worry. I will call Mr. Walden, who is the Star Telegram reporter
and ask him to accompany you." and Mr. Mark Lane called Mr. Walden of
the Star Telegram and asked him to accompany me and Mr. Walden did accompany
me with these two Secret Service men to the airport and when Mr.
Walden entered my home I told him I am so glad you are here because I didn't
want to go with this agent by myself.</p>

<p>And this is the same agent now&mdash;Chief Justice are you interested enough for
me to tell you a little more?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. About this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Tell what you wish about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We are going to go back now a little bit and then you will see
the pattern. At the end of the Six Flags; I will make it as short as possible
and when everything was Mama and we were going to live together and I told
you they took her from me and I didn't see her, then Marina's testimony started
to change, sir. Marina's testimony was not this testimony the first 3 days.</p>

<p>I have testified, and she has testified differently than me. I don't know of
all of her testimony but the first 3 days, this was not her husband's rifle, at the
police station and she admitted but it wasn't her husband's rifle. She was going
to live with her Mama and everything was fine and then when I told you the
way they did, then Marina turned against her Mama, you no have work, and
from that time Marina has been changed to a different personality, let's admit
it, sir, Marina has been changing to a different personality.</p>

<p>Her statements, her way of life, she smokes, as I said today. I am not saying
it now, she stopped nursing her baby. This is a Russian girl, I know she lived
with me 1 month, how untouched of worldly things she was, and I mentioned
before there was a lot of rumors that I didn't feel like I wanted to go into
but that I couldn't overlook.</p>

<p>Sir, if you would know the rumors, then you would put two and two together
what I have been trying to say. This man, along with the other one that I have
identified, are definitely in this pattern, and Marina Oswald, yes, Marina Oswald
has changed completely.</p>

<p>She made a statement on television now she is happy that she has ever been
and people have written, her husband is only gone 2 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, this Exhibit 270, you understand, is a transcription,
that is the writing out of what was on the tape, you understand that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But I was never taped, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We have asked, Mr. Chairman, that the tape be sent over so that
it can be heard, if you wish.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Now, you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes. It is on its way over.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have stated previously, if I was taped it was during a conversation
going on that they taped me. I have never sat down and been taped, sir.
I don't think I am out of my mind, I wonder why.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. May I see this.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Max Phillips, who is a Secret Service agent brought a
dictaphone into my home, on Thomas Place, when I left Six Flags, and I saw
it connected and Mr. Jim Cox of the Star Telegram can prove that I disconnected
it. When I was telling Mr. Jim Cox my story about putting my children
into a Lutheran home and I thought it was a personal story that had nothing
to do with this particular case I disconnected the tape recorder.</p>

<p>Mr. Max Phillips brought a tape recorder into my home and as you know I
do a lot of talking. And I never did sit down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This was a tape recording at the Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It purports to be. You understand that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I understand that thoroughly.</p>

<p>I would like to produce some other evidence that I have also to this Commission.
I have, as Mr. Doyle knows, a tape recorder with a few recordings on it,
and there are several, two, I believe. Mr. Sorrels' recordings on that. I
found it necessary, because my mail was being opened, my mail, I have reported
to the Postal Inspections, I have stated in the beginning that all of my rights
were taken away from me, and, sir, believe me they were, and when I was a
lone woman I would say something I was supposed to be out of my mind and
didn't know what I was talking about I started to decide I needed some evidence
too and Mr. Sorrels kept pushing me off about seeing my daughter-in-law, I have
him on tape, and I have Mr. Thorne on tape about my mail being opened. I
have some other evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever transcribed that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you transcribe that and send us copies of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. That is a very long document. I was never questioned
and answered.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It would hardly seem possible, Mrs. Oswald, that unless this
is a complete fabrication that anyone could have given these answers but you,
it is&mdash;so many of these questions and answers are exactly what you have told us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Exactly what I have told you, sir, I have been in the news
continuously, I have made the same statements over and over in magazines and
newspapers and press conferences, yes, sir, that is not news to anybody.</p>

<p>And as a matter of fact, I was taped, oh, this might be a point, I was taped
at my first press conference which was at the Fort Worth Press Club which I
talked approximately 2 hours, and there was a tape recorder there. I talked
over 2 hours at that press conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This is question and answer?</p>

<p>For instance, and I am looking at page 18, there are different questions and
answers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is a condensed version of my whole testimony, as I say,
because I have been in the public eye and I have all of these things public.</p>

<p>These things have been made public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This purports to be following the tape recording as to your
son Robert, you remember his giving a tape recording interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Robert gave a tape recording, I told you, and so did
Marina and I was not asked to be tape recorded.</p>

<p>I myself asked to give testimony and I did give about 5- or 10-minutes
testimony that I say again that I ended up with now all my thoughts are gone, I
see my son crying, a very short, and if I remember correctly, I started with the
defection. I do know because I said "Robert doesn't know anything about my
trip to Washington. He wasn't interested and maybe he should listen to my
testimony." And I got not far from it when Robert cried and that ended that
testimony.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, while we are waiting, you may relax. We will
take a little recess, if you want to refresh yourself, you may step out. That is
perfectly all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One thing, of course I am not supposed to tell you what to do,
I know and I don't mean to, Chief Justice, but since this man was reassigned
to guard me in Fort Worth I would like to know if he was free or if he was
taken off another assignment to come to Fort Worth to guard me for this trip?
Because it is the same man, understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I think in regard to that I had better state on
the record we had nothing to do, that is the Commission or myself, about the
selection of any of the personnel. We just asked the Secret Service to handle it
and so we don't at this time know what the answer is to your question.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right, Mr. Rankin, you may continue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, we have this transcript at this time that we
are ready to play now and it starts out with Robert Oswald's testimony or
answers and questions like the transcription, written transcription states at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
the head of it, and I think it might be helpful if we just start with that and
we can move on if you wish to with the other.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Playing of tape recording.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, this is about 3 pages out of around between 13
and 14 of your son's transcription. Do you recognize your son's voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I have to listen really, it is a recorder, I am sure, but I
have to, you know, listen, that story is right. There are two discrepancies so
far as dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you do recognize it? It sounds like him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it sounds like him. It is the recorder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Is it all right for us to pass down to yours at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, and I want the time on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would be how many pages? About the 2 months he
made an error, it is June 13 and they were in my home with me by July 14.</p>

<p>(Transcription played.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you have any problem about that being your
voice on the tape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, but I think probably the rest of it is my voice. I had
a news conference at the Fort Worth Press Club at Fort Worth, Tex., that I
was on tape for 2 hours.</p>

<p>Now, here is what&mdash;this is probably a little over 10 minutes to hear "Pardon
me, you will have to excuse me." And there was a lot of break there. That
is exactly 10 minutes. I have testified that at the Inn of Six Flags I talked for
about 10 minutes and then I stopped because my son was crying, and I still say
I testified for 10 minutes approximately at the Inn of Six Flags.</p>

<p>I had a press conference at the Fort Worth Press Club, that can be verified
that I talked for over 2 hours that I was on tape. I was sitting on a desk
with many, many reporters because this was when it just happened, and we
had a lot of reporters, and in the back of me was a man, and everything I said
was on this tape, and it was over 2 hours that I talked at this press club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say the things that you say here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In answer to these questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, and all through here is my story, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At the press club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I talked for 2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you didn't say it to this agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I said, and I am going to continue to say this, that I had
approximately 10 minutes interview at the Inn of Six Flags, and then the
telephone rang and Robert came out and started crying, and I said I see my
son crying so now all my thoughts have left me and I was not interviewed any
further at the Inn of Six Flags, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On this tape you heard a little child talking, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, was there a little child like that at <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, June was at the Inn of the Six Flags and if I am as smart
as they are and if they are as smart as I am, there could be a little child crying
all during the rest of the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I see, but there wasn't a little child at the place where you gave
your press conference?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, but I am not familiar with&mdash;but couldn't a tape be added
and spliced and couldn't a child voice be put in? I am just saying, because I
have said before and I am saying now I was taped for about 10 minutes, just
where this business came in was exactly 10 minutes, "Pardon me," now I spoke
for over two and a half hours at the Fort Worth Press Club and was taped there.</p>

<p>What they can do with that tape, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who asked you the questions when you were answering them
at the Fort Worth Press Club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Now, it was not in this sequence, answer and questions. So, I
am saying, I do not know how they can get my voice and do the tape and answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
questions for the rest, but gentlemen, I am not out of my mind and I have
said this over and over publicly, that I have never been interviewed, answer
and question, but for about 10 minutes at the Inn of the Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, then I would like to go down about 5 or 6 minutes
more maybe and see what it sounds like and the background if we play for just
a few minutes.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you drop down for another 5 minutes? Skip about 5
minutes, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After you start may I say something else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All of this here I have said and also said in my home and I have
testified that there was a tape recorder in my home brought in by Mr. Max
Phillips, Mr. Rankin. Why can't&mdash;I don't know anything about tape but it can be
spliced and edited and so forth, that much I know because when I have talked
for reporters, they don't use everything I say. They splice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you recognize, Mrs. Oswald, it would be quite a job to
splice in each one of those questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, the assassination of the President of the United States
and a scapegoat for it would be quite a job, it would be worth while, yes, sir, I
realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Let's try a little more.</p>

<p>(Transcription played.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you want to say anything more about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I do. I haven't gone through all of this. I have made
the statement over and over that my conversation was stopped. It was approximately
a 10-minute conversation and it was stopped with the remark "I see my
son crying. All my thoughts have left me."</p>

<p>Is that remark in this any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I don't recall that it is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, we will have to recall, because this, I have stated and
was said and that is when I stopped the conversation at the Inn of the Six Flags.
Robert came out crying because he couldn't get a minister and I said, "I see
my son crying, now all my thoughts have left me," and the interview stopped at
the Inn of Six Flags which I have testified was approximately 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Now, sir, there was a microphone in my home. This is not news to anybody.
I have said this over and over and over. The ordinary layman by now knows
my whole story, Chief Justice Warren. There was Mr. Max Phillips who had a
microphone in my home. I testified on tape for over 2 hours at&mdash;talked at the
Fort Worth Club, which would be, it is the same story over and over, I have told
you all the same story that you already have here.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, but it wasn't the same man interrogating you at this
place as it was at this hotel, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About now&mdash;I don't know if this is the same man on the whole
tape because I haven't listened to it. No, no one interrogated me at the Fort
Worth Press Club, sir. I talked, there was an open press.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. But it is the same voice we are hearing now asking you
questions as at the beginning of this tape, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. I have just stated, since this is a very big
operation, that this could be edited and this man's voice put on there. This I
know, because the radio stations called me and they edited what I do. Isn't this
possible, that this could be edited, and that this man asked the questions and
then my voice be put in. It would be a big job but I am asking isn't that possible?
I swear that I have never had answers and questions of this sort, gentlemen.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Shall we turn over about 10 minutes more and see if the
same voices are in it there?</p>

<p>(Transcription played.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not sure but I think it was possible it was an editor
that he put me on there.</p>

<p>(Transcription played.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, Mrs. Oswald, those are the same voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is Mr. Mike Howard's voice, yes, sir, I recognize his
voice, yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And that is your voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is my voice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. But I am not going to vary from my story.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes, all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is an interview just 10 minutes at the Inn of Six Flags
and that was the only time when going to the courthouse and asked for the
FBI of Lee getting the money to come home from the State Department and
Congressman Wright knew about it and they left and they didn't even come
back and talk to me, sir, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Play just the last part.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The last 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. These last remarks that we listened to were on page 13.</p>

<p>(Transcription played.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Those are the same two voices, Howard's voice and your
voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I say those are the two same voices, Mr. Mike Howard's
voice, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is on page 21 of the transcript. Mr. Chairman, do you
think there is any need for any more?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I don't see any need for going any further with it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oswald says she didn't have this interview, these questions were not
asked of her and these answers given but she does identify the voices as being
hers and all we have is her word, and this tape, and the transcription at the
present time. So for the moment, I suppose we will just have to leave it where
it is.</p>

<p>I don't see any other answer to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mrs. Oswald, I have shown you during a recess what has been
marked as Exhibit 271, and you have examined the handwriting of that exhibit.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the various letters there. Can you tell us whether or not
those handwritings on those various letters are those of your son, Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It looks like his handwriting, I would say so. I am not handwriting
expert. It looks very much like his writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you. We offer in evidence Exhibit 271.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. It will be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document was received in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 271.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We understand, Mr. Doyle, that you have examined the original
documents of Exhibits 244 through 257, and compared them with the photostatic
copies that have been marked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And stipulate for the record that the photostats are correct, of
the originals, is that agreeable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have nothing further unless Mrs. Oswald has something or
Mr. Doyle cares to interrogate Mrs. Oswald about anything.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, do you have anything more you want to say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I don't have anything more. Do you have any questions,
Mr. Doyle?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Doyle, do you have anything to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. I have no further questions, no.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Oswald, for appearing voluntarily
before the Commission and giving your testimony, and Mr. Doyle, I want
to express the appreciation of the Commission for the help you have been to
Mrs. Oswald and to the Commission in representing her on this occasion. We
know that it disrupted your week very badly. We know that you responded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
this call for public service on a moment's notice, and we appreciate it all the
more because of that.</p>

<p>My own personal thanks to you in addition to those of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Thank you, Your Honor. I assume that my designation was for
the purpose of the hearing and with the conclusion that will have finished my
job.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you. Unless Mrs. Oswald should like to ask you some
questions about the matter at the conclusion of the testimony, I think that will
be all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you both.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You and I are through as attorney and client?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This will not be pursued any further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Unless you have some questions, thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Gentlemen, you are making a very big mistake. I thank you
very much for inviting me here.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I don't understand you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think you are making a very big mistake not pursuing this
further because I have told important people about this particular incident and
I say it is correct and I hope you will continue while I am gone not just to ignore
what I have said.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mrs. Oswald, you misjudge the Commission when you say
we will not pursue it further.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fine, I don't know, I am asking.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may be sure we will pursue it further.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you, and I have more people that I could call. I have
told Mr. Doyle the people.</p>

<p>Would you like me to name the people on the record for you? Mr. Lane, I
called Mr. <span class="locked">Lane&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. To what purpose are you naming these people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the purpose that Mr. Mike Howard who came to Fort Worth
last week to protect me, I called these people and told them how concerned I
was that he was the one.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think you have told us what you told them, so that we have
it here in the record now.</p>

<p>We are adjourned.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, the Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>I will make a brief statement for the benefit of Mr. McKenzie and Mr.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order
No. 11130, appointing a Commission "to ascertain, evaluate and report upon
the facts relating to the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy
and the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination."</p>

<p>On December 13, 1963, Congress adopted Joint Resolution S.J. 137, which
authorizes the Commission or any member of the Commission or any agent
or agency designated by the Commission for such purpose to administer oaths
and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.</p>

<p>On January 21, 1964, the Commission adopted a resolution authorizing each
member of the Commission, and its General Counsel, J. Lee Rankin, to administer
oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence concerning
any matters under investigation by the Commission.</p>

<p>The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr. Robert Oswald,
the brother of Lee Harvey Oswald, who prior to his death was charged with
the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Since the Commission is inquiring fully into the background of Lee Harvey
Oswald and those associated with him, it is the intention of the Commission
to ask Mr. Robert Oswald questions concerning Lee Harvey Oswald on any and
all matters relating to the assassination.</p>

<p>The Commission also intends to ask Mr. Robert Oswald questions relating
to the assassination of President Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of
Lee Harvey Oswald. Mr. Robert Oswald has also been furnished with a copy of
this statement and a copy of the rules adopted by the Commission for the
taking of testimony and the production of evidence. Mr. Robert Oswald has
also been furnished with a copy of Executive Order No. 11130, and Congressional
Resolution S.J. No. 137, which set forth the general scope of the Commission's
inquiry and its authority for examining witnesses and receiving evidence.</p>

<p>That is just for your general information, Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>You are here with your attorney, Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Would you state your name for the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Commission, my name
is William A. McKenzie. Our office is 631 Fidelity Union Life Building, Dallas,
Tex. I am a member of the State Bar of Texas and licensed to practice before
the Supreme Court of that State.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And you are here to advise and represent Mr. Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I am here to advise and represent Mr. Oswald. And I might
state, further, that Mr. Oswald will freely give answers to any questions that
the Commission might desire to ask of him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>There are present at the Commission this morning Mr. Allen Dulles, Commissioner,
and myself. I will be leaving fairly shortly to attend a session of
the Supreme Court, but in my absence Mr. Allen Dulles will conduct the hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. Oswald, would you please rise and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God, in all of these proceedings at which you are
to testify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, if you may pardon me for just a second.
In coming down to the Commission's hearing room, I left part of my file in
Mr. Jenner's office, and I have asked Mr. Liebeler if he will step out and get
the file.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You would like to wait for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If you don't mind.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I might add, while we are waiting for that to come back,
that Mr. Albert Jenner, one of the associate counsel for the Commission, will
conduct the examination this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I would like to state for the record that I have furnished to Mr. Jenner and
Mr. Liebeler this morning a letter dated February 17, 1964, dictated by myself,
but signed by Robert L. Oswald and witnessed by Pete White, Joan Connelly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
and Henry Baer, which I would like for the Commission to have a copy of,
and which I furnished to the Commission.</p>

<p>And, further, that I have furnished to Mr. Jenner and Mr. Liebeler, counsel
for the Commission, a letter dated February 18, 1964, signed by Mrs. Marina N.
Oswald and witnessed by Declan P. Ford, Katherine N. Ford, and Joan
Connelly.</p>

<p>The reason that I furnish these letters to the Commission I think will be
obvious from a reading of the letters, and, secondly, will likewise explain my
position to some extent.</p>

<p>And, further, I have furnished to Mr. Jenner and Mr. Liebeler letters dated
February 18, 1964, addressed to Mr. James H. Martin, 11611 Farrar, Dallas,
Tex., signed by myself, and likewise signed by Marina N. Oswald, and witnessed
by Katherine Ford, a copy of which I furnished to Mr. Lee Rankin, counsel for
the Commission; and a letter of like date, February 18, 1964, addressed to Mr.
John M. Thorne, Thorne and Leach, Attorneys and Counselors-at-Law, of Grand
Prairie, Tex., signed by Mrs. Marina N. Oswald, and witnessed by Mrs. Katherine
Ford.</p>

<p>I furnish these to the Commission for the Commission's information.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Is there anything, Mr. McKenzie, you would like to know about our procedure
that you are not acquainted with? It is very informal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, I will say this. This is the first time I
have had the privilege of appearing before such a distinguished group of citizens
of this country, headed by yourself, and that we are ready to proceed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Jenner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>May I suggest the wisdom of identifying each of these series of four letters
with an exhibit number, and may the reporter supply me with the next number.</p>

<p>The first letter mentioned by Mr. McKenzie is the letter dated February 17,
1964, addressed to Mr. McKenzie, and signed by Mr. Robert L. Oswald, witnessed
by Mr. Henry Baer, Joan Connelly, and Peter White. That will be marked
Commission Exhibit No. 272.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 272, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The second letter mentioned by Mr. McKenzie is dated February
18, 1964, also addressed to Mr. McKenzie, signed by Mrs. Marina N.
Oswald, and witnessed by Declan P. Ford, Katherine N. Ford, and Joan Connelly.
That will be marked Commission Exhibit 273.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 273, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next letter is dated February 18, 1964, and addressed to Mr.
James H. Martin, identified by Mr. McKenzie, and signed by Mrs. Marina N.
Oswald, witnessed by Mrs. Katherine Ford. Two pages.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 274 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next and last of the series is a letter of the same date,
February 18, 1964, addressed to Mr. Thorne, John M. Thorne, signed by Mrs.
Marina N. Oswald, and witnessed by Mrs. Katherine Ford, two pages.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 275 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may at this time, I would like to make one
other statement to the Commission.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Before you do that, may I ask if you want those introduced
into evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits 272 through 275, inclusive, the
documents that have been so identified and marked.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. They may be admitted.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 272 through 275,
inclusive, for identification, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Now, Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
We have brought with us the original copies of various letters received from&mdash;dating
from 1959 through 1962, from Lee Harvey Oswald to Robert L. Oswald,
together with some copies of a contract between Mr. Oswald&mdash;Robert Oswald,
Marina Oswald, John Thorne, and James Martin. We bring those voluntarily
and gladly. I would like to give them to the Commission with the understanding
and stipulation that they will not be released to the press or to any news
media, with the exception and understanding of your final report.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is the only purpose we would have in having them, and
we will not release them to the press or to any other person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I understand that, sir. And the only reason I make that
stipulation is for the record.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes. With the understanding that the Commission will use
it for any purpose that is within the scope of the Executive order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. And for no other purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Do you want to keep the originals and have copies made
for us, or do you want to leave the originals with us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Well, sir, we have already started making the copies this
morning.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is all right. Either way you want to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Whichever way the Commission would prefer.</p>

<p>But we have started making copies this morning.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. That is all right, then. You may do it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenner, I guess you may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>We have made copies of a number of the originals, additional ones of which
are also being made. And as I identify the documents, I will be asking leave
to introduce photostatic or xerox copies of the originals, and I will so indicate
at the appropriate moment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Dulles&mdash;we have had a very short session
with Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Oswald, which has been pleasant and of the character
indicated here, with full cooperation by both gentlemen. And we have
explained to Mr. Oswald that this particular phase of the matter covers Lee
Harvey Oswald's entire life, and I added it also covered Mr. Oswald's life.</p>

<p>At times the particular thrust of the examination might not be particularly
apparent to Mr. McKenzie, but he is at liberty to inquire as the case might be.
But we are covering the entire lives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, would you be good enough to state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Robert Edward Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you reside now where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At 1009 Sierra Drive, Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your present business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am employed by the Acme Brick Co. in the capacity of sales
coordinator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What city or town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the nature of your employment by that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am in the market department of the Acme Brick Co., coordinating
between the marketing and plant department, scheduling the plant's
production, processing and handling all orders, correspondence relating to the
orders, and generally following through in the line of customers service, from
prior to placing the orders by various customers, architects, home builders and
so forth, to the completion of the invoices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long have you been so employed by the Acme Brick
Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. April of this year, 1964, will be 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I think it might be helpful at this point&mdash;what is the date
of your birth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. April 7, 1934, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you tell me how many years old you are?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will be 30 years old April 7, 1964.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Jenner, if you excuse me now, I am going to attend a
session of the Supreme Court. And if you are here this afternoon, I will be
back to be with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span> (presiding). You may proceed, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you. Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Would you identify your family&mdash;Mrs. Oswald, and your two fine children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you. My wife's name is Vada Marie Oswald. My
daughter's name is Cathy Marie Oswald, and my son's name is Robert Lee
Edward Oswald, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The ages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Cathy is 6 years old, and Robert Lee will be 3 years old this
April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give us Mrs. Oswald's maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Vada Marie Mercer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is a native of your present town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. She is from Keeter, Tex. My wife was raised on a
farm. This community is located close to Boyd, Tex., which is approximately
35 miles northwest of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Your father's full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Robert Edward Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Edward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is now deceased?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as I recall, he died in August of 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then about what&mdash;5 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Five years old, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your mother is Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall her middle name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Claverie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was her maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think it was Claverie. You have a brother, John Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. John Edward Pic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is a stepbrother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And born of a marriage of your mother with whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me. He is a half brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He is a half brother, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am sorry to say that meant the same thing to me. But I am
probably in error. A half brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry. I didn't hear the next question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all right. You correct me when I am wrong. Don't
hesitate to do that.</p>

<p>Your half brother's father was whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This I do not know. I don't know his full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it John, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would be of the opinion it was John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never had any acquaintance with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I might further say I don't believe I have ever seen
a picture identified as being John's father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are speaking of the father now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>And your half brother, John Pic, is older than you, is he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you happen to recall his age?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he is now 33 years old. His birthday is January 17,
1932.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During your lifetime, you have had contact with him, have you
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as boys, the family lived together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your mother, Mrs. Marguerite Claverie Oswald, was married
a third time, was she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Edwin, I believe his middle initial was M. Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did that marriage take place, to the best of your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1944 or early '45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you become acquainted with him prior to the time of the
marriage of your mother to Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I certainly did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you indicate the general circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, we was residing at Dallas, Tex. I don't recall the
address. It was Victor Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say <span class="locked">"we"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was my mother, John Edward Pic, myself, and Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Residing at the Victor Street address, in Dallas, Tex. I recall that perhaps
more numerous occasions he was there&mdash;now I can say three or four times
he was around the house prior to the marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the nature of your mother's employment, if she
was employed, in the period immediately preceding the marriage of your mother
to Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry, sir, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she was employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I do recall that this was quite a large house. It was
a two-story house. And she was renting apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Serving as a rental agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. She owned the house, to my knowledge&mdash;she owned this
house. I believe there were two upstairs apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition to that, was your mother separately or independently
employed&mdash;that is independently <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe so, sir. Where, I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at that time all three of you boys were attending&mdash;would
that be elementary school at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Elementary school, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would have been prior to Lee's sixth birthday, I believe,
and he would not be attending at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you and your brother John were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough to tell the Commission as much as
you can recall, especially of your early life&mdash;elementary school days. We are
not going to probe into this in any great length. But we would like the background
and flavor in which the family lived.</p>

<p>Start as early as you have any reasonable recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>I believe after my father's death in 1939, John was attending elementary
school. We lived at the corner of Alvar and Galvez, in New Orleans, La. And the
school was right across the street from us, elementary school.</p>

<p>John, of course, <span class="locked">started&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir.</p>

<p>Did I ask you where you were born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, you did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was born in New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Excuse the interruption.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. John attended the school approximately 2 years before I started
elementary school. And during this time, the way I remember it, it was a frame
building. But by the time I attended first grade it was a brick school building.</p>

<p>I do not recall attending for a very long period, because I <span class="locked">believe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the name of the elementary school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may interrupt at this time&mdash;Robert, in giving
this narrative, tie it down as closely as you possibly can to date, to names, to
street addresses&mdash;just give us as complete detail as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The names of the school, the names of your teachers, and so
forth, if you recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I was at the point that I don't recall attending this
school very much. I perhaps was there the first full year. However, approximately
around this time&mdash;this would be in 1941&mdash;mother placed John Edward
and myself in a Catholic school, which I do not recall the name of, but it was
located in Algiers, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a suburb of New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Just across the Mississippi River from New Orleans proper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question, Mr. Jenner?</p>

<p>In this school, did you live there, and spend the night there&mdash;you were living
there all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or were you going home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; we were living there.</p>

<p>Lee, of course, at this time, was still very young, and he stayed with mother.
I don't recall any address particularly at that time. We were at the Catholic
school for approximately 1 year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would take you to 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>And, at that time we were moved by mother from the Catholic school and
placed into the Bethlehem Orphan Home, in New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>We used to refer to it as the BOH.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir, if I interrupt you at that point.</p>

<p>That would be 1942?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The best I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee was only 3 years old. So the "we" did not include Lee, is
that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. It included John Edward and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As Mr. Dulles inquired of you at the Catholic school&mdash;was this
an orphan home in which both you and John lived at the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Twenty-four hours a day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did Lee reside during this period of your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall the address at that particular time.</p>

<p>I might state that I know mother had sold the house on Alvar and Galvez
Streets in New Orleans, and they were living elsewhere, I remember the house,
but I cannot remember the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was particularly interested in whether Lee was living with
your mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. He was at this time living with mother. And it is
my understanding from her, during later years, discussing with her, that she
had various maids or housekeepers come in to keep Lee at this early age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, I take it, she was employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she also employed during the 1 year when you boys were
at the Catholic school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sure&mdash;I feel sure she was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could we say, except as I might return to the subject specifically,
that from the time of the death of your father, in August of 1939, at least until
the time of her marriage with Mr. Ekdahl, she was always employed, either
continuously or with short breaks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we certainly can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was the sole support, as far as you know, of your family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I interrupted you&mdash;pardon me.</p>

<p>You and John entered the Bethlehem Orphan Home. Would you describe to
us the nature of that school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a public or private institution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say it was a private home. The atmosphere generally&mdash;of
course all the boys and girls were separated&mdash;I recall just one large
dormitory building, sleeping area and so forth. The cafeteria was <span class="locked">located&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you tell us about how many there were in this orphanage,
roughly? Was it 50, 100, 200?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say around 75 to 100, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you are now about 8 years old, am I correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1942&mdash;that would be correct, sir.</p>

<p>The cafeteria was located in a separate, or perhaps a wing of this large
dormitory building. The school area was located in a separate building towards
the entrance of the home. There was quite a large playground there, and
quite a large playroom within that large dormitory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The home itself was located in New Orleans, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the city proper, rather than a suburb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that was so, sir. I still recall that it was pretty
close to the end of the St. Charles Street carline at that particular time.</p>

<p>My recollection of the atmosphere and the general conditions there&mdash;it was
nice, I had a lot of friends there at the home. It was a Christian atmosphere.</p>

<p>Going back to the Catholic school&mdash;we had to go to church every morning and
so forth like that.</p>

<p>But here at the tables and so forth we had our grace and such as that. It
was generally a Christian atmosphere there. He treated us well, I might add&mdash;better
than the Catholic school did. They were not as strict as far as discipline
was concerned, but they certainly kept us in line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question there?</p>

<p>Was this a denominational school, or a publicly maintained school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't believe it was a denominational school. I believe it was
a public&mdash;I feel it was a private school or home. But that the religious background
did not have anything to do with it. It might have been just a Protestant
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am curious, if I may, Mr. Dulles&mdash;the name of this school or
home is the Bethlehem Orphan Home. But neither of you boys was an orphan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, that apart from the name of the school, there
were orphans and young people, children such as you, whose mothers, or perhaps
fathers, were unable to take care of them during the daytime completely, and
the school accepted children under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Therefore, it was not exclusively for orphans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think I have read somewhere&mdash;I would like to ask, if I may&mdash;I
understand there had to be only one parent, though. I don't think if you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
two parents you were eligible for this school. I don't know where I read that,
but I recollect that.</p>

<p>Is that the case, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My recollection on that, sir, was that I do recall mother saying
something that there was a little difficulty in placing us in there, because we
were not orphans. But that they had from time to time made exceptions to
this, where one parent was living and unable to attend the children fully during
the day and so forth, and even at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you entered in 1942. Did you and John continue in this
school&mdash;for what period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Until we moved to Dallas, in 1944, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before we get to that, has Mr. Oswald responded to the questions
you had in mind, to describe the nature of the school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you visited by your mother and Lee to the extent that she
brought him along, when you and John were in the Bethlehem Orphan Home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we were. I do recall quite vividly that on Wednesdays&mdash;this
perhaps might have been during the summer months only&mdash;that John and
I would go to downtown New Orleans and meet mother at her place of employment,
and either spend the afternoon with her, or she would give us money to
go to a movie or something. And at this time mother was employed as a manager
or assistant manager of a hosiery shop located on Canal Street. I don't recall
the name of it, or the exact address of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough to inform the Commission to the best
of your recollection about weekends? Did your mother visit you on weekends?
Were you free to return home and spend the weekend? Describe that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall on the weekends&mdash;a weekend, I should say, that
we visited mother. Normally, we just saw her once a week at that particular
time. I do not recall&mdash;I have been thinking about this&mdash;seeing Lee too often at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and John would be naturally curious to see him once in
awhile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I know we did. I cannot remember it too clearly.</p>

<p>But I would say that it wasn't too frequently that we did see Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you moved to Dallas in 1944?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there anything unusual prior to the time you moved to
Dallas about your life and your relationships with your mother and with Lee,
if any? Was there an event that is now etched on your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would like to back up there just a little bit.</p>

<p>Lee was placed at the Bethlehem Orphan Home for approximately the last
year that we were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be, then, 1943?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He would have been 4 to 5 years old then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. He was born in October 1939. So he would then be approximately
4&mdash;well, when he was placed in Bethlehem Home it was some time
during the year 1943, to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough to relate to the Commission the
circumstances that brought that about? What do you recall as to why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My opinion on that, sir, was this. That mother had wanted
to bring Lee to the home at an earlier date, but that they had a minimum
age required before he could be placed in there, because they did not have any
real small children there. I mean there was no nursery there that I
recall. And there was no very young children. When I say very young&mdash;say
under 3 years old.</p>

<p>I remember some children there that perhaps were four or three and a half
years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, Mr. Oswald, your mother put Lee in the orphan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
home at the first opportunity open to her under the rules or policy of
the Bethlehem Orphan Home in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did she come to visit the home when Lee was placed in
the home?</p>

<p>If I may, you recall you said you were free on Wednesdays, it may have
been limited to the summer time, and you and John would go into the New
Orleans town district and visit your mother.</p>

<p>Did she come to see Lee? Does that stimulate your recollection that
she did come to visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she did come to visit us. I recall after Lee was
placed in the home, that all three of us would go down and visit mother,
and we always took Lee with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. What contact did you have with Lee in that 1-year
period, in 1943, when he was with you boys in the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. John and I both looked on Lee as our kid brother, and we
stayed pretty close to him, and defended him whenever we had to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did Lee get along during those days?</p>

<p>Let's confine it to up to 1944, when you moved to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't recall any instance where it would stand out in my
mind that he did not get along with anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had the normal life of a 4-year-old at that particular time&mdash;got
into his fights to the extent everyone else did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You mean at the time he was 4 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There may be others who would be interested in his course of
conduct and his reactions even at age 4. You will forgive me for going into
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your present recollection, as far as Lee's relationship
with other 4-year-olds or 5's or 3's, his general course of conduct, with regard
to the interplay between himself and others at or near his age, is what
you would describe as normal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now we are moving to Dallas in 1944. You brought out the fact that Lee
became enrolled in Bethlehem Orphan Home, because I asked you questions
whether there was anything unusual etched on your mind at that time
that had occurred up to the point of your moving to Dallas. Was there anything
else that this discussion, that is now stimulated that you would like
to report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I cannot think of anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what was the reason you moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't really know, sir. Of course we were quite happy to
leave the Bethlehem Orphan Home. By that, I don't mean to imply that
they didn't treat us well there. But, of course, we were quite happy to
be with mother again, all of us together.</p>

<p>As to the reason why mother moved us to Dallas, I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you moved to Dallas, you resided&mdash;can you
recall the address or at least approximately where you lived in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As I recall, it was Victor Street. It was a corner house, a
large two-story white&mdash;I feel sure it was a frame white house. The garage
was to the back side of the house. Victor Street ran in front of the house,
and another street down the side where you entered the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't think I asked you this. It is a little bit out of
order.</p>

<p>Do you happen to recall your brother John's date of birth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; you did ask me that. It was January 17, 1932.
Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
Your mother, did she become immediately employed in Dallas, or had she
already arranged for employment in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This I do not recall, sir. I feel more like that she perhaps
had arranged for employment in Dallas before we moved there. I would
think this would be the natural thing to do. We had never been to Texas
before. And, to my knowledge, she didn't know anybody in Texas.</p>

<p>And why we moved to Dallas, I certainly don't recall any reason at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any relatives in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did Mr. Ekdahl reside? Was he living in or a native
of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I understand Mr. Ekdahl was from Boston, Mass., and he
was at that time&mdash;I believe that is correct, sir&mdash;at least the way I remember
it&mdash;employed by the Texas Electric Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At what office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Dallas. It might not have been Texas Electric. Texas
Power and Light, perhaps&mdash;something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Mr. Ekdahl was then living in Dallas when you, your mother,
your brother John, and your brother Lee moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had you become&mdash;you boys become acquainted with Mr.
Ekdahl prior to the time you moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recall any discussion of Mr. Ekdahl prior to the time
of your moving to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your education was, of course, continued when you moved
to Dallas.</p>

<p>Would you tell us about that&mdash;all three of you? You and your brother John
first, because Lee was not yet of school age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>I recall the elementary school there in Dallas. It was the Davy Crockett
Elementary School, which was approximately three or four blocks from the
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Davy Crockett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Both you and your brother John were enrolled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And there was&mdash;I believe it was a city park right
across the street from this elementary school that I recall playing ping pong
and croquet and swimming over there, and such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This period of your life, as you recall it, was a pleasant one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And except for the restrictions that you and John encountered
in the Catholic school and in the Bethlehem Orphan Home, what is your recollection
of that early period of your life&mdash;subject to those limitations&mdash;normal
and pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only thing I can remember&mdash;I did have a little difficulty
because I had something of a southern drawl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you reached Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And I do recall having a little difficulty in school myself,
to make myself clearly understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask a question there?</p>

<p>When you went to the Davy Crockett School, was that a school where you
lived, or did you live at home and just attend the school during the school
hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was a public school in Dallas, and we did not live there.
We lived at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And your mother then was employed, as I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my knowledge&mdash;I feel certain she was employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the nature of her employment there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was employed full-time during the daytime, home on weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what was happening to Lee when you were living in
Dallas&mdash;in the sense of who took care of him during the daytime, if anyone?
What was done for his comfort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This I don't remember, sir. I don't remember any housekeeper
or any maid that mother had at this time. Something is coming into my mind
about a day nursery. I think <span class="locked">perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A day nursery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;that Lee was taken to during the day when Mother
was working, and brought home with her at night. I believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you boys take him to the day nursery and bring him home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you play any part in that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not have any recollection of taking Lee to the day
nursery or bringing him back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please indicate how long you remained in the
Davy Crockett Elementary School, you and John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Say for 1 year, sir, 1 school year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, during this year, did you become acquainted with Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I would say towards the latter part of that school year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He could come&mdash;he did on occasion come to visit your mother's
home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please indicate whether the contact that you boys
had with Mr. Ekdahl about that&mdash;that is, he would visit the home occasionally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he take you boys out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't recall. I think perhaps on maybe two occasions we did
go to the zoo. I don't recall any other occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We now have you towards the latter part of the year&mdash;you were
now 9 years old. Am I correct about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1944, I would be 10 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother John was 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your brother Lee was then 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you continue&mdash;when did you change&mdash;you said you stayed
at Davy Crockett Elementary School a year. And then you entered what
school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the fall of that year we entered Chamberlain-Hunt Military
Academy, at Port Gibson, Miss. That was the fall of 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what was the date that you gave me as to the marriage
of your mother and Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately the early part of 1944. That is what I stated
before. And I think now that it would be more correct&mdash;after we completed
the year at Davy Crockett, I believe they were married shortly after the end
of the school year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is in June, probably?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; somewhere along that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that would be&mdash;June of '44?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. June of '45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that following the marriage of your mother and Mr. Ekdahl&mdash;what
was his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Edwin A. Ekdahl. I believe his middle initial was "A."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was employed, as you stated, by a utility company in
Dallas at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you have a recollection or did you come to learn the
arrangements, if any, between Mr. Ekdahl and your mother as to the financing
of the attendance of yourself and your brother John at Chamberlain-Hunt
Military Academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother told us that she was taking care of all the expenses
at the Academy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She told you at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. This is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was your understanding of both you and John at that
particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That she was financing your attendance at the military academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was she working at that time, or during the period that she
was married to Mr. Ekdahl was she a housewife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe after the marriage to Mr. Ekdahl, she was not working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a conversation with her, and did you then come
to learn, or have you subsequently come to learn as to how she did finance
your attendance at the military academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not. I assume at that particular time that&mdash;I did
not know the quantity of life insurance that my father had when he passed
away. I thought it was perhaps substantial. Perhaps to me at that time,
a young age, $4,000 or $5,000 was a lot of money. From the insurance money,
from my father's death, she was able to place us in this military school in
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do I recall correctly that you also testified earlier that your
mother sold&mdash;there was a home in New Orleans which was sold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And possibly some of the proceeds of the sale of that home were
still intact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be my opinion, that it was. I do not know if the
home was paid for or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is all speculation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may interrupt.</p>

<p>Robert, don't speculate, and don't give any conjecture. Tell what you know,
and give them the facts as fully as possible. But I am confident that the Commission
is not interested in any speculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if you do speculate, tell us so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes&mdash;indicate that you are speculating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do we know the amount of insurance on Mr. Oswald's life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I cannot give you the figure, but it is small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is known in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Following your mother's marriage to Mr. Ekdahl, did he move in to the
residence where you were living, or vice versa, or what were the circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. He did move into the home on Victor Street, following
the marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were living, though, in the military academy. Was that a
school where you lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You lived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Day and night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During the period that we went to the military school, we stayed
there day and night, through the 9 months of the school year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the distance from Dallas&mdash;in general&mdash;to the military
school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It is approximately 600 or 700 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was 30 miles south of Vicksburg, Miss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Quite a distance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So you could not go home weekends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; we did not go home weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the time of the marriage of your mother to Mr. Ekdahl,
to the time you boys left for military school, you all lived in the home on Victor
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He moved into the home immediately upon the marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question?</p>

<p>Was there a summer holiday, then, when you went home from the military
academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were home for 3 months, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That would be in the summer of '45?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The summer of '46.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might help if you tell us how long you and John remained
at the military school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Three school years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be in 1945, 1946, and 1947.</p>

<p>So that you left the military school approximately in June of 1947, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would be correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. '48 or '47?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, the school year would be 1945 through '46 would be 1 year,
'46 through '47 would be 2 years, '47 through '48 would be the third year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. June of '48?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And I might say there, when school&mdash;the last year
that we were there, when school was completed, mother had indicated to us
that she wanted us to go to summer school and stay up there that summer. And
we did, John and I, stay there at the school after practically all the other ones
had left, because I recall helping pack away some old Springfield rifles at that
time in Cosmolene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The marriage of your mother and Mr. Ekdahl terminated in
divorce, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I believe that this would be some time in '47. I believe
she had divorced Mr. Ekdahl before our final year at the academy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Liebeler will get the date. I don't recall it myself at the
moment.</p>

<p>Did your mother and Mr. Ekdahl have occasion during this 3-year period,
plus the summer school, to visit you and John in the military academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they did. I recall Mr. Ekdahl coming there with
mother and Lee in a 1939 Buick at that time, that I recall. I don't recall many
occasions that Mr. Ekdahl was there. I might state that at Christmas time I
believe on each year that we were up at the military school that we returned
home. By home, I mean Fort Worth, or wherever they were living. One year
I believe it was Benbrook, Tex., outside of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you be good enough, having mentioned that, to state
for the record where your mother and Mr. Ekdahl resided during the period of
time you were at the military school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe the first <span class="locked">year&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Chronologically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first year that we attended there, Mr. Ekdahl was on the
road quite a bit. And they had during the winter of 1945 gone to Boston, where
they stayed, I would say, for approximately 6 months. I understand Mr. Ekdahl
had been married and had a son by a prior marriage, and they had lived together,
all of them&mdash;Lee, my mother, Mr. Ekdahl, and his son&mdash;in Boston. But
that he was on the road quite a bit. And I recall a picture of mother and Lee
in Arizona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Living in Arizona?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not living. On one of the trips.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. One of the trips with Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Ekdahl, and mother and Lee had gone along with him. Whether
this was a business trip or a vacation trip, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Following their living for 6 months in Boston, where did they live thereafter,
during that period of time, until the divorce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe after they left Massachusetts, they moved to Benbrook,
Tex., and resided at Benbrook, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where is Benbrook with respect to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is&mdash;well, with respect to Fort Worth, that to me would be
easier to say, it is just a little ways northwest of Fort Worth, on the edge of
the city limits of Fort Worth now. At this particular time it was just more
or less a wide spot in the road. The house&mdash;I recall going there, perhaps this
was during Christmas leave from the academy&mdash;the house was a good sized
stone home that had some acreage with it. There was a creek that was perhaps
400 or 500 yards behind the house. I remember, I believe, right before we arrived
on this first occasion, Lee had found a skunk out there. He didn't know
what a skunk was, but he found out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Benbrook is a suburb of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, Benbrook is a suburb of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>As I indicated, at that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you fix the year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be&mdash;I feel certain that this was the first year that
we were in military school, and the first Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The first Christmas. That would be Christmas 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me. Let me back up earlier.</p>

<p>They were in Massachusetts at that time.</p>

<p>This would be the second year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, the first Christmas, 1945, included the period
when your mother, Mr. Ekdahl, and Lee resided in Boston with Mr. Ekdahl's
son by a former marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that the living in Benbrook, Tex., followed the termination
of the stay in Boston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>But I do recall now the first Christmas that I was at the military school,
because they were so far away, and it was impractical to travel that distance
in that length of time&mdash;that John went with some friends of his that he made
at the academy and stayed at their home&mdash;I don't recall where.</p>

<p>I remember I went with one of my friends and stayed at his home during
Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were friends of yours in the academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. And their parents agreed to that&mdash;because
they didn't want us to stay up in the academy at Christmas time more or
less by ourselves. They wanted to have us with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You seem to have a rather vivid recollection of the Benbrook,
Tex., home. I take it that during a summer vacation you lived in Benbrook,
Tex., with your mother and Mr. Ekdahl and Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This particular house I refer to, a native stone home&mdash;I
believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that you did have at least two summers at home while
you were at the military academy, and the third summer your mother asked
you to stay during summer school, and you did not come home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She asked us, and it was the intent that we stay. But at the
last moment we did not go to summer school that year at the academy. We
did come to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, may I interrupt you please?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Robert, when did you leave, or when did your mother sell the house on
Victor Street in Dallas. Tex., if you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe she sold it at the time that they moved to Boston,
Mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That was some time prior to Christmas of 1945, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>If I may ask this, sir: If someone would furnish me the date of the divorce.
I believe this would help tie down some other dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I want to assure the Commission and counsel that the copy
of the transcript of Robert Oswald's testimony will not be given to the press
until such time as the Commission makes its final report&mdash;if at that time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I think that is most important, that we don't indicate
that they will never be given to the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No. That was made clear before you came in&mdash;that this
would be available for use in connection with the report in any way that
the Commission saw fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it all right to proceed, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes, please, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The second residence, then, was&mdash;I mean the second one
during this particular period we were talking about, was in Benbrook, Tex.</p>

<p>How long, or over what period of time did your family reside in Benbrook,
Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say at least approximately a year or a year and a
half at that particular house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say in that particular house. Did they occupy another
home in Benbrook, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was&mdash;on our return from military school, the last year
we attended, when we returned, mother had purchased a small home there
in Benbrook, a little bit closer in to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This was after the divorce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; this was after the divorce.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She owned the original house in Benbrook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not the stone house. I believe Mr. Ekdahl had rented
that house, or leased it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Then she purchased this second house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right. After the divorce, she purchased this smaller
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Until you boys returned from military academy, or at least
until the time of the divorce of your mother and Mr. Ekdahl, she was not
employed? She was home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my knowledge, that is correct. She was not employed at
that time, or during the marriage to Mr. Ekdahl&mdash;she was not employed at
any time I am aware of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And able to give the normal and full time and attention of a
mother to her son, Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, during the summertime, when you did spend summer
vacations back in Benbrook, Tex., you had an opportunity to observe personally
on this subject, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That your mother was not employed, and she was caring for
Lee during that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she have any assistance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, she did not. None that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No household help?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; none that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question there? Maybe you are going to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
that. I would like to ask as to&mdash;was Lee Harvey going to kindergarten at this
time, or where was he from an educational point of view?</p>

<p>He was 7 or 8 years old now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. He was 8 years old&mdash;he was 6 years old when they moved
to&mdash;the commencement of the military school period, your brother, Lee, was 6
years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Six years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is about the time when you enter elementary school, is
it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That I entered elementary school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No&mdash;children generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I don't believe, however, though, that Lee at the age of 6 went to elementary
school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us what the circumstances were in that connection,
to the best of your recollection, and now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir. To the best of my recollection, it was that Mr.
Ekdahl was traveling quite a bit, and that mother was traveling with him, and
Lee did not attend a school during that year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee travel with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that he did during that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are trying not to speculate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I believe, to my best recollection, that the school age&mdash;commencement
age was 7 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think what we are trying to get at is what was Lee doing&mdash;was
he with the mother, was he in some kind of kindergarten?</p>

<p>Do you recall during those 3 years you were in the military academy&mdash;where
was Lee?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When you say the school age, in Texas, you mean the
mandatory attendance age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jaworski</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, that is what I have reference to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jaworski</span>. I recall, if I may add, at the age of 6, children were normally
sent to kindergarten in those days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you have now related it to us, Mr. Oswald, in this period,
let's call it the military school period because we have identified the time
question&mdash;at the commencement Lee was then 6 years old. And as we now
learn, normally that would be a kindergarten period.</p>

<p>He was traveling or accompanied his mother, your mother, and Mr. Ekdahl
in their travels in connection with Mr. Ekdahl's business, and he was not either
in kindergarten or otherwise in school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am of this opinion&mdash;he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was your information at the time that you and John
were attending military school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would be correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know where he was, and who was taking care of him
during that period&mdash;if your mother was traveling with Mr. Ekdahl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe Lee was going with them, sir, during these travels. I
don't recall&mdash;other than this one photograph&mdash;at one time they were out in
Arizona. I don't recall any other places that they traveled to. I am sure
mother, she was writing us quite frequently, John and I, usually just one letter
to both of us&mdash;any other names or areas that they had traveled during this
period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, may we proceed to the succeeding school period, which
would be the year '46-'47. He is now at that time 7 years of age. Your mother
and Mr. Ekdahl and Lee were then residing in Benbrook, Tex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Benbrook; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee enter elementary school at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did. I don't know if the school name was Benbrook
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was an elementary school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I know where it is located there and everything. I
believe it is closed down now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You learned of this during the summer vacation, or from letters
from your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;one way or the other during that period
we were aware that Lee was attending school in Benbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to this point what were the relationships between yourself and
your brother John? Cordial and normal brother relationships?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I might say then as now they were cordial. We always got
along. He was a little bit older than I was, of course. He had his group of
friends, I had mine. We got along just fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the relationship of your brother John and yourself on the
one hand, and Lee on the other&mdash;let us take the 6- to 7- to 8-year-old period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. John and I both, I feel, especially from my side, that we were his
big brothers, and when we were around Lee we took care of him. We played
together, to some extent, anyway. Perhaps our interests were a little bit different
than Lee's at that early age of his life&mdash;a spread of 5 years between Lee
and I and 7 years between Lee and John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. That is quite a gap.</p>

<p>A boy 6 years old who has a brother 11 years old&mdash;that would be you&mdash;and
a brother 13 years old, that would be John&mdash;at that age, that is quite a gap.</p>

<p>Did you spend much time with him, for example, when you were home during
the summer vacations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I would say we did spend quite a bit of time&mdash;both
John and I&mdash;with Lee.</p>

<p>I recall going fishing, things like that. But mostly I recall staying at the
house at Benbrook, the native stone home, out there, and staying within the
confines out there, and playing, and staying out there most of the time.</p>

<p>I do recall on a number of occasions that Mr. Ekdahl, my mother, and all three
of us would drive into Fort Worth and go to the movie theater, which at that
time was the closest one coming in from Benbrook into Fort Worth. I recall
going there quite a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate for us as you recall now the relationships
between you and John&mdash;between you boys and your mother? Was that a
pleasant one? Were there any difficulties that you now recall? Personality-wise,
for example.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall. At that time, I do recall one instance out
there at the house, stone house there in Benbrook&mdash;my mother was a little
upset with Mr. Ekdahl over the fact that&mdash;this was, I am sure, the second
Christmas we were there from military school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be 1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would be 1947, Christmas 1946. He was showering us
with candies, cokes, and so forth. And mother thought that he was overdoing
it. And we argued the other way. We was on Mr. Ekdahl's side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your relations with your mother, as you recall them now,
during this period were pleasant, normal, and you were having no difficulties
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; pleasant memories to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything other than the difficulties two lively boys have when
they are naughty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were you conscious at that time of the growing difficulty between
your mother and Mr. Ekdahl? Was that apparent at that time? Or
did that only come later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. At that time, it was not apparent to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At no time was that a factor in your life, particularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I would say at no time it was. In moving up perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
there to the time of the divorce and everything, I don't remember when Mr.
Ekdahl moved out of the house. At that time we were living on Eighth Avenue
in Fort Worth. This was during a summer period there. And I think this was
the summer after the second year that we attended there&mdash;this would be the
summer of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If it is agreeable, I think we will adjourn for just a minute.
It is now 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Dulles, may I suggest that we get what the law
was in Texas at the time, as to when children mandatorily had to attend school?
I think that can be checked out very simply and put in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. I think that should be in the record.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will come to order. We will resume, Mr. Jenner,
with your questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>It may well be, Mr. Chairman, that the Exhibits 272 through 275, which
although already admitted in evidence, may play some part in these proceedings
at some future date. And may I further qualify the exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. McKenzie, would you be good enough to hand them to the
witness?</p>

<p>Would you turn to the second page of Exhibit No. 272, Mr. Oswald? Are you
familiar with the signatures on the second page of that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you identify them, please, in the order in which they
appear, and state whether or not they are the signatures of the persons who
purported to have signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My signature, Robert L. Oswald, I signed it. Witnessed by
Henry Baer, Joan Connelly, and Pete White. And they are known to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they affix those signatures in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are persons known to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify them for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Henry Baer is a partner in William A. McKenzie's law firm,
in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is Mr. McKenzie's partner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss Joan Connelly is the secretary in that firm.</p>

<p>And Mr. Pete White is an associate partner in the law firm of Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, that that document was executed in Mr. McKenzie's
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now, Mr. Jenner, may I interrupt at this point? I would
like to add for the record that I was not present at the time that this letter
was executed or witnessed. However, I did dictate it in the presence of Mr.
Oswald and, of course, to my secretary, and, of course, to my partner, Henry
Baer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Miss Connelly your secretary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you take the second letter in that group, and give me
the exhibit number&mdash;turn to the exhibit page and identify the situation similarly,
if you are acquainted with them, and state whether it was signed in
your presence and where.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 273&mdash;I was not present when this letter
was signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the letter bear your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with the signatures of those who purported to
have signed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not familiar with the signature&mdash;I am familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
signature of Mrs. Marina N. Oswald. I am not familiar with the signature of
Mr. Declan P. Ford or his wife, Katherine N. Ford.</p>

<p>I am familiar with the signature of Joan Connelly, Mr. McKenzie's secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please identify who Mr. and Mrs. Ford are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The best way I could do that, I believe, is that they are friends
of Marina N. Oswald. I became acquainted with Mrs. Ford on Wednesday 2
weeks ago, whatever date that is, and Mr. Ford the following day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were the circumstances under which you became acquainted
with Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me just a minute.</p>

<p>I would like to correct that.</p>

<p>It was Tuesday rather than Wednesday 2 weeks ago that I first became acquainted
with Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>At that time, Mrs. Ford acted as an interpreter between Mr. Thorne and myself
to relate to Mrs. Marina Oswald what we were talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir. You mentioned a Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Mr. John Thorne who at that time was the attorney for
Mrs. Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did this take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At my residence, at 1009 Sierra Drive, Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was present at that time in addition to yourself, Mr.
Thorne, and Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My wife, Vada Marie Oswald, was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your acquaintance with Mr. Ford, you say, was the following
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did that take place, and in whose presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At my residence, again, in Denton, Tex., in the presence of my
wife, Vada, Mrs. Marina Oswald, and Mrs. Kathy Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to Mrs. Ford, it is 2 weeks ago last Tuesday, or 2 weeks ago
today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me just a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Two weeks ago this past Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would hesitate and make reasonably certain of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I have erred here.</p>

<p>Instead of being 2 weeks ago this past Tuesday, it was a week ago Tuesday
that I first met Kathy Ford. And it was the following day, on that Wednesday,
that I met Mr. Ford. In other words, I wish to correct it was not 2 weeks ago,
but 1 week ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now that you have a calendar before you, would you give us the
date so we will have it in the record now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Tuesday, February 11, 1964, was the day I first met Mrs.
Kathy Ford in the presence of Mr. John Thorne and my wife, Vada, in my home
in Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>On February 12th I met Mr. Ford in the presence of my wife in my residence
at Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Returning to the exhibit to which you have been directing your
attention, which is No. 273, you were able to identify Mrs. Marina Oswald's
signature, and Miss Connelly's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The others you were unable to identify?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Would you turn, then, to the next exhibit, give us the number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 274.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it signed on its face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, then, directing your attention to the first page of the exhibit,
does it bear a signature?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose signature is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. William A. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the Mr. McKenzie present here representing you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does that exhibit consist of more than 1 page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Turn to the second page. Does it bear a signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with those signatures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The two signatures appear on the second page. One I am
familiar with&mdash;Mrs. Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir. Is that the first of those that are in a series?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are familiar with that, and that is her signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next signature purports to be that of whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Katherine Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your testimony, if I repeated the questions that I did as
to the previous exhibit, regarding Mrs. Ford, would be the same? You are not
familiar with her signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the next signature, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is the only two signatures that appear on that second page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you proceed to the next exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 275.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That consists of how many pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does it bear a signature on the first page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There is a signature on the first page. The signature is Mr.
William A. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are familiar with that signature, and that is his signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same gentleman we have identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Are there any signatures on the second page of that
exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. There are two signatures on the second page, and in
order as they <span class="locked">appear&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Are you familiar with either of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am familiar with one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Let's take the first one, which is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are familiar with her signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that her signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I would say that was her signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the second name appears to be that of whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Katherine Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your testimony with respect to her, were I to pursue it,
would be the same as you testified to a previous exhibit, insofar as your
familiarity with her signature is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Forgive the interruption, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, Mr. McKenzie has produced for us and tendered
to us four documents, during the recess, which I would wish to identify. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
have a relationship to the exhibits, the signatures of which I have just finished
having identified.</p>

<p>Would you mark those, please, Mr. Liebeler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you wish these admitted as exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you please, sir. I would like to identify the exhibits and indicate
their content first.</p>

<p>I would call on you, Mr. McKenzie, to identify the series of exhibits. They
are numbered, Mr. Chairman, Commission Exhibits 276, 277, 278, and 279.</p>

<p>If you will identify them, I may have some questions of the witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chairman, Exhibit No. 276 is a contract dated December
6, 1963, addressed to Mr. James H. Martin, Dallas, Tex., and signed by Mrs.
Marina N. Oswald, consisting of four pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wish that admitted at this time with that description.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If I may put one question to the witness: Mr. Oswald, would you
look at the last page of that exhibit? Does it purport to bear a signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There are three signatures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with all of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I ask my attorney something here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may interrupt you, and pardon me for doing
so&mdash;on page 3 there is likewise a signature. And I think perhaps he should
start at that page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a fine suggestion.</p>

<p>Will you now refer to page 3. Does it bear a signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose signature is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Turn to page 4. There are several signatures on that page,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. There are three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you take them in order, taking the uppermost one first.
Indicate whether you are familiar with that signature, and whose signature it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is my own signature, Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next under that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. James H. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is his signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Mr. James H. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was, at that time, when this contract was signed, appointed
as Marina's business agent. But employed at the Inn of the Six Flags at
Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He has been identified in previous sessions before the Commission.</p>

<p>And there is a third signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And are you familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. John M. Thorne, Attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is the Mr. Thorne that we have identified a few moments
ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was at that time the attorney for Mrs. Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a fourth signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were those signatures affixed in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Jenner, I believe these are photostatic copies, are they
not, that are being identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. McKenzie, would you please make a statement with respect to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir. I was going to at this time, Mr. Jenner, state for
the record that Exhibit 276 is a photostatic copy. And this photostatic copy was
furnished to me by Mrs. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where is the original of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Marina N. Oswald has the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Has that been so compared, that we know this is a true copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chairman. Pardon me.</p>

<p>I retract that statement.</p>

<p>Marina N. Oswald furnished to me a copy of this exhibit, but it was a signed
copy, and it was an original copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A duplicate original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes. And I presume Mr. James Martin had the original,
since it is addressed to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And both the original and this duplicate bear these signatures,
do they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I have never seen the original, sir, but I presume that they do.
And I think Robert Oswald here can clarify that, because he was present at
the time that the original was signed, and also the duplicate copies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And the duplicates were signed by the same parties as the
original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask&mdash;did you get a copy of the original at the
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I received a copy in the mail the second day after the
signatures were signed. My copies were unsigned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, were you present when all of the copies were contemporaneously
signed, if they were contemporaneously signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you know of your own knowledge that what has been termed
here the original, which may be in the possession of Mr. Martin, was signed,
and was signed in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the document which we are now discussing is a photostatic
copy of a carbon copy of the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Executed contemporaneously with the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you have any further questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No, I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Shall we admit this at this time, or do you want to wait until you have
gone through them all, and then admit them all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might be more convenient to identify them all, because they
are of a series, if I have your permission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The next document is Commission Exhibit 277, and purports
to be a photocopy, or is a photocopy of a purported contract between Marina
N. Oswald and Robert Oswald, bearing the date of December 9, 1963, and
purportedly signed by Marina N. Oswald, Robert L. Oswald, John M. Thorne,
attorney, and James H. Martin, approved as to form, and consisting of two pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, if you would turn to the second page, please, sir&mdash;I notice
a recital, "Executed by the undersigned parties this Ninth day of December
A.D., 1963," and what purports to be your signature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Was this document, or that of which this is a Xerox copy, executed on that
date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not have a calendar before me. If the ninth day of
December was a Monday, it was signed on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Dulles is checking the calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am afraid I don't have a 1963 calendar here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am observing a calendar, and the ninth was a Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. McKenzie, does the previous document also bear a date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It bears the date of December 6, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. December 6, then, was a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If Monday was the ninth, Friday was the sixth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the previous exhibit, which is numbered 276, executed on
December 6th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what date was it executed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was executed on Monday, December 9th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Despite its bearing a date of December 6th, it was actually
executed on the ninth, when Commission Exhibit 277 was executed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, directing your attention to the second page of Exhibit No.
277, that likewise bears a series of signatures. I ask you first whether those
signatures were affixed in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was the document now identified as 277, which is a
Xerox copy&mdash;was the original of Exhibit 277 executed at the same time as the
copy which you have produced for us executed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have that again, please, sir?</p>

<p>Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, there were a series of papers, original and carbon
copies, signed, at one and the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And all of them were signed in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, there are four signatures on that page. Would you proceed to state
your familiarity with those signatures and identify them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Left to right, as the signatures appear&mdash;my signature, Robert L. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the right of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And to the right of that, the signature of Mrs. Marina N.
Oswald, which I am familiar with.</p>

<p>The next signature is Mr. John M. Thorne, attorney, and I am familiar with
his signature.</p>

<p>And the last signature that appears on this second page, Mr. James H. Martin.
I am also familiar with his signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And these persons are the same persons you have heretofore
identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the document of which this 277 is a Xerox copy in the
same condition now as it was the time those signatures were affixed to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have a moment, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that likewise true of Exhibit No. 276?</p>

<p>Would you take a look at it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct. And if I may say this about this&mdash;on
page 3 of Exhibit 276, you will note that towards the upper right-hand part
of this page there was&mdash;on this copy, there is a dark mark, following the word
"royalties."</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What page is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Page 3, the sixth line, the word that was crossed off or out of
the contract was the word "gifts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that done in the course of the discussion and preceding
the execution of the document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So the document is in the same condition it was when executed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify the next exhibit, Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The next exhibit is a photocopy of an investment agency
agreement. It is Commission Exhibit No. 278. This exhibit bears the date of
December 30, 1963, and is an agreement by and between John M. Thorne and
James H. Martin, co-trustees, of Dallas County, Tex., referred to in the exhibit
as principal, and the First National Bank of Fort Worth, Tex., referred to in
the exhibit as agent.</p>

<p>The exhibit consists of 3 pages, together with a schedule A and a letter addressed
to the Trust Department of the First National Bank of Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>This exhibit is a photocopy of a photocopy of a duplicate original.</p>

<p>I have seen the duplicate original upon which it had the names, handwritten
names of John M. Thorne, co-trustee, and James H. Martin, co-trustee, as principal,
on page 3, and Preston A. Utterbach, Vice President and Trust Officer of
the First National Bank of Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>However, these Xerox copies of a copy, being a photocopy, do not have the
signatures on, because the second photocopy did not reproduce the signatures.</p>

<p>I have seen those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Xerox machine was unable to pick up the signatures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No. The prior photocopy was unable to pick up the signatures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Because they had not been put on, or because they didn't pick
them up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It would not pick them up, Mr. Dulles. The signatures were
on the instrument itself, but the photo machine would not reproduce the signatures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You actually saw the signatures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you see that document, Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Marina N. Oswald gave it to me in my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state the thrust or substance of those agreements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The substance of it is that Mr. Thorne and Mr. Martin, as
principals, constituted the First National Bank of Fort Worth as the agent
to hold certain trust funds, consisting, as shown by the exhibit, attached to
this exhibit, of $25,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was deposited with the First National Bank of Fort Worth
under this trust and deposit agreement, agency agreement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I presume that to be true. I know Preston Utterbach. And if his signature
was on it, I know that the funds were deposited there at the bank, or else he
would not have executed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask the source of these funds, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I do not know them, sir. But Marina Oswald has told me
that she felt that the funds came from contributions made to herself and her
children, from various sources, of which I know nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Did you use the word "felt." She told you she felt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the extent of your personal knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, do you have any personal knowledge, apart from
or in addition to that of Mr. McKenzie, with respect to the source of the funds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say this was monies received through the mails, and
delivered in person to Mr. Thorne or perhaps Mr. Martin by various people
who wanted to contribute to Marina's welfare and her children's welfare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Upon what is your statement based? Conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Conversations, and also <span class="locked">being&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With whom, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She related this to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Anybody else? What about Mr. Thorne and Mr. Martin? Had you had
conversations with them as to the source of these funds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I would say that would be correct, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did these conversations take place in the presence of Mrs.
Marina Oswald? Your conversations with Mr. Thorne and Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I recall, sir. I am thinking perhaps, when I was
aware at first that the $25,000 was to be placed in the trust fund at the First
National Bank of Fort Worth, I learned this through a conversation on the
telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With Mr. Jim Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with Mr. Martin's voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you call him or did he call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did this take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately a week prior to the actual deposit and setting
up of the trust fund at the First National Bank in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Jenner, I suggest we get a copy of the deposit
slip or some other validation of the actual amount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, sir. We will undertake to do that. These documents,
as I have indicated, were produced for us during the recess. We don't
have the full information.</p>

<p>Perhaps, Mr. McKenzie&mdash;you have been quite helpful. You might be further
helpful to us&mdash;you might have the deposit&mdash;evidence of the deposit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, I wish I did have it. However, I know that the
First National Bank of Fort Worth would gladly duplicate that for you. And
I contemplate that I will be in the process of obtaining a copy from either Mr.
Thorne or Mr. Martin in the very near future, because I have asked both of
those gentlemen, on behalf of Marina Oswald and her children, for a full and
complete accounting as of February 18, 1964, and I will likewise say that she
has informed me up until February 18, 1964, she has had no accounting from
either of those gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there another exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The next exhibit, Mr. Jenner, is Commission Exhibit No. 279, which is a
Xerox copy of a power of attorney granted to the firm of Thorne and Leach,
attorneys and counselors at law, bearing the date of December 5, 1963, in which
it has three&mdash;I presume these are omissions from the exhibit&mdash;commencing
on line 4, following the words "trust funds", there is an omission, and then the
word "bequests", and then there is another omission, and on line 5, at the
beginning of that line, there is an omission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is the nature of the omissions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Dulles, I have been told that the word "gifts" was
omitted. The word "gift" was originally in it. But I have been told the word
"gift" was omitted, or struck out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Dulles, I had intended to question the witness about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. This contract provides that Marina N. Oswald, "bargain,
transfer, sell and assign an undivided 10 percent of all such sums when
collected or paid to my account," referring to the fund in the preceding paragraph.
The agreement is signed by Marina N. Oswald, witnessed by James H.
Martin, and accepted by John M. Thorne.</p>

<p>I am familiar with Marina N. Oswald's signature, and this is a copy of her
signature, or is her signature. I am not familiar with Mr. Martin's signature
or Mr. Thorne's signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to that document, Mr. Oswald, are you
familiar with any of the signatures it bears?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify each signature and indicate those with which
you are familiar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As they appear in order, the first signature is Mrs. Marina N.
Oswald. I am familiar with this signature.</p>

<p>The second signature is Mr. James H. Martin. I am familiar with his
signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is his signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that under "Accepted"&mdash;is that first word there "John"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And the last signature as appears on this Exhibit 279
is the signature of John M. Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know the day upon which that document was executed?
It bears a date of December 5, which is a Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Pardon me&mdash;the 5th day of December is the date purported&mdash;that this document
was executed at. I am not familiar that it was executed on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with the date when it was in fact executed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not. I might further state I was not present
when this document was signed, and I was not aware of this document until
Thursday, February 13th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">19&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I inquire of you, Mr. McKenzie, whether you have seen the
original of the document of which this purports to be a Xerox copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I have not, sir. But I have seen a duplicate copy, an original
copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A duplicate executed copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was furnished to you by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. By Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is a photostatic copy of what, with respect to an
original, carbon copy or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It is a photocopy of a carbon copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you personally seen the carbon copy of which this is
a photo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the document now identified as Commission Exhibit No.
279 in the same condition now as it was when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the best of your recollection, is it a duplicate of the
original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The next exhibit is Commission Exhibit No. 280 entitled "The Oswald Trust,"
and bearing a heading, "The State of Texas, County of Dallas, Know all men by
these presents," and it is a trust agreement dated December 30, 1963, by and
between Marina Nikolaevna Oswald "a widow, hereinafter called grantor, and
John M. Thorne and James H. Martin of Dallas County, Texas, co-trustees,
hereinafter called the trustee" in which it describes certain funds described on
Schedule A attached to this exhibit, which consists of some six pages, plus the
Schedule A, Schedule A describing the trust funds as cash, $25,000. And I
might add, in my opinion, Mr. Jenner, for whatever it may be worth, that this
trust grants to John Thorne and James Martin purportedly grants unto those
two men as co-trustees absolute discretion as to the distribution of the trust
funds.</p>

<p>In fact, on page 2 it says, "as the trustee shall in either case in its uncontrolled
discretion deem advisable."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who is the beneficiary of this trust?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Marina Oswald and her children, in the discretion of John
Thorne and James Martin.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Is that $25,000 the same $25,000 referred to in a previous
exhibit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Ford, I presume so. But that is only a presumption
on my part. I do not know.</p>

<p>I might further add, for the benefit of counsel and the Commission, that
Marina Oswald has informed me, and I think Robert Oswald can testify as to
this, which I leave to your discretion, that at no time have these, up until
February 14&mdash;have <span class="locked">these&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. 1964&mdash;have these exhibits, numbered consecutively from 276
through 280, been read to her in Russian. And at the time of execution, they
were not interpreted, nor did they show of the contents&mdash;what the contents were,
except as explained to her in English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. McKenzie, the document is identified as Commission Exhibit
No. 280, directing your attention to page 5, has blanks for signatures, and names
of grantor and co-trustees under those lines.</p>

<p>Could I ask you whether you have seen the original of this document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I have not, sir. I have seen a copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An executed copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. To the best of my recollection, it was an executed copy, yes,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And from what source did you obtain or was the document exhibited
to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The document was given to me by Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you observed that it was executed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the persons whose names appear on page 5 of the Exhibit 280?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I have made these exhibits available to the Commission for whatever purpose
they may serve the Commission, and for no other purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. I think we might want to reserve on that until the whole
Commission can get together. We want to examine everything within the mandate
we have been given by the President. We don't want to go afield, quite
naturally. And we cannot tell at this stage what bearing these particular papers
might have. So I think I would like to reserve judgment on these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Well, Mr. Dulles, I made that statement in view of that fact.
I felt that that would be true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. McKenzie, for the purpose of our record, would you be offended
if we had you sworn, so you could then state that the statements you
have made to the Commission are true and correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I would not be offended in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you, Mr. McKenzie, swear that what you have stated, is the
full truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I do, Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits 276
through 280, inclusive, the documents that have been so identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They may be accepted.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 276
through 280, inclusive, for identification, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wish to state, in accepting these documents, the Commission
does not want to pass on or assume any responsibility with respect to the
financial or other arrangements described in these documents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I sought to identify them, Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen, and to
tender them in evidence because of events of the past few days, and to confirm
Mr. McKenzie's authority to speak on behalf of Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the recess, Mr. Oswald, we were dealing with&mdash;excuse me.</p>

<p>We were dealing with the period of time that you and your mother and your
two brothers lived in Benbrook, Tex. This brought us through the summer of
1948, I believe.</p>

<p>Am I correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Liebeler has determined that the divorce of Mr. Ekdahl and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
your mother took place in 1948. We cannot give you the month and the day in
1948, but it was during the year 1948.</p>

<p>We had reached the point in which you related to us that, I believe, following
the divorce of Mr. Ekdahl and your mother, she purchased a small home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And refresh my recollection, please&mdash;was that in Benbrook, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That was in Benbrook, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have we reached a point now at which your brother, Lee, had
entered elementary school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you boys have now terminated your attendance at the
military academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you please relate what elementary school you and
your brother, John, attended, and Lee, if he attended the same school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Prior to the school year of 1948&ndash;49, we moved to Ewing Street,
7408 Ewing Street, within the limits of the city of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the home that had been purchased in Benbrook, Tex., sold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you state that you would say. Is that your best information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any transactions in regards to the selling of that home or
anything. Since we did move, and she did purchase this home on 7408 Ewing
Street, in Fort Worth, I would assume that she did sell the house at Benbrook,
because she didn't rent it, and we no longer went out there. I feel sure she
did sell it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I understand you to say that your mother purchased a
home at 7408 Ewing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you, in very short compass, tell us the physical characteristics
of that home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was a two bedroom, asbestos siding, with an attached garage,
red roof, small porch on the front, and an average sized lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These homes you have been describing all have, as I recall it&mdash;have
either attached garage or separate garages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;with the exception of the home there in Benbrook
that my mother purchased after the divorce from Mr. Ekdahl&mdash;it did not have
a garage, and I did not recall a garage at the native stone house in Benbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The purpose of my inquiry was, did the family have an
automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that true when you lived in Louisiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my best recollection on that&mdash;my father did have, at the time
of his death, either a 1937 or 1938 Chevrolet. I believe my mother sold it after
his death. I believe she did not own an automobile in New Orleans, when we
were at the Bethlehem Orphan Home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you boys interested in automobiles, as most young teenagers
are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tinker around with them, drive them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Both you and your brother John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Later on, in later years, did your brother Lee&mdash;was he likewise
interested in automobiles, did he tinker with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir, did he tinker with them. Even
though I can recall a couple of occasions with automobiles that I owned that
he would assist me in any repairs I might be making on the automobile at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I have in mind his interest now. Was he a good driver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my knowledge, he did not drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not drive at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see him drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. On two or three occasions in later years, I
offered to teach him to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall this specifically now, do you? Would you relate to
the Commission this course of events in his life&mdash;a young man who never did
learn, at least to your knowledge, to drive an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>The first occasion that I recall that I offered to Lee to teach him how to
drive&mdash;at that time, I owned a '56 Chevrolet. I had married, and I was residing
at 7313 Davenport, Fort Worth, Tex., a home which I had purchased. And Lee
was home on leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give us the time, please, as closely as you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be some time in 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was then in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was home on leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. State the circumstances, will you please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With relation to my offer to teach him how to drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. How did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, he was spending a day, or part of a day over at our house.
We were going to the grocery store or something&mdash;Lee and I. As I backed out
of the driveway, I recall saying something to him, or he brought it up, or
something&mdash;about wanting to learn how to drive.</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, we can start right now."</p>

<p>It was an automatic transmission.</p>

<p>"It is the easiest thing in the world to do. There is nothing to worry about.
And I would be right here with you."</p>

<p>Well, he didn't think that was the time to try to start. He did want to learn
how to drive, though. And he did not take the wheel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>At no time was I present when he took the wheel of a car and drove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on any occasion in your lifetime, did you ever see him,
whether you were in the vehicle&mdash;whether or not you were in the vehicle&mdash;behind
the wheel and actually operating in motion an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have never known him to operate an automobile, to
drive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Mrs. Marina Oswald in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; to my knowledge she does not drive and she does not
know how to drive, and I have never seen her operate an automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice when you are smoking that you hold the cigarette in your
left hand. Are you left handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I am left handed when I write and eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are right handed otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Throwing a baseball?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Throwing a baseball.</p>

<p>At one time I could handle it with both hands&mdash;especially a football better than
a baseball. But I have returned to my right hand on that. I was more accurate
with my right hand than with my left hand, in throwing things. I kick footballs
right footed and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about your father? Was he right handed or left handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This I do not know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother is left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your brother Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was right handed.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there ever a time that he appeared to be left handed,
as far as you recollect?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I have never known him to handle anything&mdash;throw
a baseball, football, et cetera, fire a rifle, or do anything, left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In order to be certain of the details in this respect, when he
wrote, did be write with his right or his left hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Right handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you in fact have seen him write with his right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During your youth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever&mdash;was there ever an occasion when you saw him
write or attempt to write with his left hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have never seen him at any time, on any occasion, ever
attempt to write or do anything left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You really covered my next question, but I would like to ask
it anyhow.</p>

<p>There are men in athletics who are either right handed or left handed, but
who throw or bat or do something from the other side.</p>

<p>Did he ever throw left handed or in any athletic endeavor employ his left
hand predominantly as against his right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge, he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your many years of experience with him, being associated
with him, as his brother, was he a predominantly right-handed person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he most certainly was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. And you personally saw him throw, kick, or do anything
athletic over the years, and saw him use his right hand exclusively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I would say without qualification&mdash;I might be repeating
myself here&mdash;at no time did I ever know him to do anything left handed,
to the extent that it would be predominant. Of course his hands worked together,
and so forth. But I have never known him to do anything left handed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your long acquaintance with him, and your intimate knowledge
of his physical characteristics in that respect, do you have an opinion as
to whether he was instinctively right-handed or instinctively a left-handed
person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say he was instinctively a right-handed person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In all the years you were with him, you had opportunity to see
him react instantaneously without having time to think about using his right
hand or left hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you observe him on many occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I have never known him to use his left hand in any manner
when an occasion would require that he use either hand&mdash;instinctively went to his
right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a coordinated person in the use of his right hand? Some
are not coordinated athletically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My opinion of this, sir, would be that he was coordinated to the
extent that looking at myself and many, I would compare us as two peas in a
pod. Quite fast, well coordinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was dextrous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And well coordinated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had an opportunity over the years to see him engage
in athletics, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During your youth, as a young man, in any event, did you and
your brother John and Lee have an interest in guns, rifles, pistols, cap guns,
firearms generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we certainly did. I would say this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this includes all three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I understand that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Of course John and I, when we attended military school, we had more of an
opportunity to become acquainted with firearms. We certainly played with
cap pistols, rubber guns, et cetera, when we were young. Lee did the same
thing.</p>

<p>However, I would say this. Mother did not like firearms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will recess now until 2 o'clock this afternoon.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT EDWARD LEE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Jenner, will you please continue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Reporter, would you read the last question and answer we have so we
can orient ourselves.</p>

<p>To refresh your recollection, Mr. Oswald, I had commenced to examine you
with respect to the interests of yourself, your brother John, and your brother
Lee in firearms, even at the children's stage. And you had indicated developments
in that area as you became older.</p>

<p>I think you reached the point where, as an example, you said of course your
brother John and yourself had attended military school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And, also, I believe, sir, the question referred to all three of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To what extent we were familiar with firearms.</p>

<p>To elaborate, at military school John was by far the better shot of the two
of us. He was on the school rifle team. And, at this time, I was 10 years old&mdash;when
I first attended there. My hunting instinct came alive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Hunting instinct came alive, and at the first opportunity I
started hunting squirrels and so forth there in Mississippi. I did this on practically
every occasion I had. John was on the rifle team. And up to that
time, a number of years after that, we never had a firearm in the house.
My mother didn't like them. She was scared of them. And after we moved
to 7408 Ewing Street, none of us owned a rifle, even a .22, or a shotgun, or
any type of firearm. And when I wanted to go hunting from there, I had various
friends that had rifles that I would borrow, and I would go to the west
side of Fort Worth, and Benbrook, and do my squirrel hunting.</p>

<p>I don't recall at anytime during that period that Lee went with me. I
don't know that John did&mdash;because approximately this time he had reached
the age of 17, at which time he joined the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is when you moved over to Ewing Street in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to that time, had you and Lee at any time gone hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any time that we went hunting at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was 1948&ndash;49. So he was 9 to 10 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had, to your knowledge, Lee gone hunting or used firearms or
played or been interested in firearms with you or with your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. To my knowledge I don't remember any time he went
hunting with myself or my older brother John. As I stated, there was no
firearms in the house.</p>

<p>He liked cap pistols, like any other kid. And to the extent that we didn't
even own a BB gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever had BB guns around your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you boys ever owned one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By this time, I assume you had shot one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Owned by one of your pals or somebody around the neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee had what you would describe as a normal interest in
firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That every boy has?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But not beyond that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there any pistol or rifle ranges around that you boys
attended?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your brother John at this point entered the Coast Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were attending&mdash;you were then 15. You were now attending
high school, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Junior high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fort Worth, W.&nbsp;C. Stripling Junior High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was the name of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. W.&nbsp;C. Stripling Junior High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother John attend high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What high school did he attend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We went for awhile&mdash;to get this thing in sequence, before he
went into the Coast Guard he attended Arlington Heights High School in Fort
Worth, I believe, for one-half year, and then he transferred to Paschal High
School in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you attended either of those high schools?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; Arlington Heights High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think I might go back a little bit. I will return to the firearms.</p>

<p>But to maintain the sequence, when you and your brother John came to
Benbrook, Tex., after you completed your schooling at the military school, I
assume you attended school in Benbrook, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; we did not, because we were just there during the
summer months. And we moved prior to the school year of <span class="locked">19&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. '48?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. '48&mdash;we moved to the address on Ewing Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And each of you then enrolled in Arlington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was in the ninth grade, which was junior high school in Texas.
I enrolled in W.&nbsp;C. Stripling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And John Edward enrolled in Arlington Heights High
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. W.&nbsp;C. Stripling High School was a junior high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Arlington Heights High School was senior high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; the last 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, at this time, your brother Lee was enrolled <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. West Ridglea Elementary School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So at this point each of you was attending a different school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee was 9 years old.</p>

<p>You continued at Arlington Heights Junior High School for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;W.&nbsp;C. Stripling Junior High School. For 1 year, the
ninth grade.</p>

<p>If I may, sir, perhaps correct something&mdash;I don't know for sure which way it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
was. When I said Lee attended West Ridglea Elementary School, I think perhaps
the first year he attended Arlington Heights Elementary School, because I
don't believe the West Ridglea Elementary School was completed at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We might take you in sequence so that at least I don't get confused.</p>

<p>You spent a year at W.C. Stripling High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So we now have&mdash;we are now into '49-'50, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And after a year at W.C. Stripling High School, you enrolled
where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Arlington Heights High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that would be in the fall of 1949?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you attended Arlington Heights High School how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I attended my sophomore year. In my sophomore year I
<span class="locked">started&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that be 1951, the end of your sophomore year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; 1950 would be the end of the school year. That summer
there I started a job with an A&amp;P Supermarket there in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>I might say along this period mother seemed to be having difficulty keeping a
job or making enough money and so forth to raise us. I stayed out of school
that next year and worked for A&amp;P.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Out of school 1950&ndash;51?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother remain in school&mdash;John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. John at this time was in the Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Already in the Coast Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And you worked at the A&amp;P during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you contribute your earnings to your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were probably not a great amount at this age. Do you
recall what they were, per week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps my starting salary was somewhere around $48 a week,
or something like that. I believe by the end of the year I had become a checker,
and perhaps it was $65 or $70 a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What proportion of that did you contribute to the sustaining of
the family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say practically all of it, but what I needed for expenses,
a little spending money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether your brother John made an allotment of
any kind to your mother or sent her any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my knowledge, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any illness or disability of any kind that contributed
to your mother's difficulty in obtaining positions during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she was not disabled. I don't recall any particular
length of illness that she had at this time that would not allow her to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the reason, if you recall, she was having difficulty in
obtaining work, or was there any particular reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir. No particular reason I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother Lee was living at home during this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he working after school, or making any effort to earn some
money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was not. He might have on occasion mowed somebody's
lawn or something like that, where he would have a little spending
money, or something. But nothing frequently, consistently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Proceeding with you, at the end of the school year '50-'51&mdash;I assume you
continued working there the summer of '51?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you reenter school that fall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Arlington Heights High School.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>During this 1-year period that you worked for the A&amp;P, Mr. Oswald, were
you the principal source of income for your mother, Lee, and yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mother was working. Whether or not I was making more
than she was at that time, I do not know.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She was working spasmodically or regularly during this
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe almost regularly, very little off. I cannot recall right
now what she was doing. I think perhaps during this period she was selling
insurance.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. While she was in this occupation, who took care of Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, no one did. Lee was, of course, at school. When he
returned home from school in the afternoon, he managed for himself, until
I or my mother returned home from work.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. He was 9 or 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Eleven years old.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think Representative Ford's question may have been induced
by the fact you said that at about this time of which we are speaking your
mother was having trouble retaining her position or obtaining positions. I
assumed from that, perhaps incorrectly, that there were gaps, there were times
when she was not employed, and, therefore, did need you to remain out of school
to help. Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that is a fair statement and generally so. A little
more comes to mind there.</p>

<p>I believe, perhaps, that she might have been selling insurance. I think she
was acting at that time as what you would call a hostess or a welcoming party
for the city of Fort Worth. In other words, she went out and met new people
coming into Fort Worth&mdash;something along that line. And apparently it wasn't
very much money, very little. And I think during this period also she was
trying to locate other types of work that would perhaps earn her more. I
believe that would be more accurate to what I really had in mind, there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But during all of the period, from the divorce of your mother
and Mr. Ekdahl, proceeding from that time forward, she again returned to what
she had been doing prior to the marriage&mdash;that is, working to sustain the
family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if I may use the expression you did, Lee was left to shift
for himself during the daytime, get to school, get back to school, and be around
until either you boys returned to the home or your mother returned to the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because he didn't have anybody particularly assigned or who
undertook to care for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>I might say you mentioned "you boys." Of course at this time John was in
the Coast Guard, so it was either myself or my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And particularly during the year you were employed at the
A&amp;P, and your mother was also employed, then certainly during that period
there was no one even available to take care of him, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were your hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My hours varied somewhat. We had different types of shifts
for different days. Normally perhaps from 7 to 4 or 5 o'clock, and on the
weekends&mdash;stock day was Wednesday, when all shipments came in, to restock
the store. That was Wednesday and Saturday. Usually they were long days.
I worked from 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night. And on Saturdays
practically always after the store was closed, we did the cleanup, and rewaxing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the floors and sometimes it was anywhere from 10 to 10:30 at night, and perhaps
even 11 o'clock before I was home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did Lee's school at that time keep him until about 4 o'clock,
do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, that would be&mdash;he was, of course, at that time,
attending West Ridglea Elementary School. I believe it would be about 3 o'clock,
because I believe high school at that time&mdash;we were getting out at 3:40. And
I believe the elementary school was either 40 minutes or an hour earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You attended Arlington Heights High School for the school
year '51-'52?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what about the year '52-'53?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. July 1952 I joined the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in July 1952, when you joined the Marine Corps, what do
you recall was your status as far as your schooling was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I completed my junior year in high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you enlist for 3 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your brother was still in the Coast Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he was still in the Coast Guard at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, at that time, I take it your brother Lee was attending Arlington
Heights High School? That would be 1952?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Just a minute, please.</p>

<p>In 1952 Lee was 13 years old. He would be attending W.&nbsp;C. Stripling
Junior High School then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. For the school year 1951&ndash;52?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Junior high school there was from the seventh to
the ninth grades. And as soon as he was through with his sixth year, he
started attending W.&nbsp;C. Stripling Junior High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As soon as he finished the sixth year at Ridglea Elementary School,
he entered W.&nbsp;C. Stripling High School, as a seventh grader?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;junior high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the condition that you described as to Lee shifting for
himself during the daytime, when your mother was away working and you
were away working, and your brother John was in the Coast Guard, continued,
I take it, when he began attendance and while he was attending W. C.
Stripling Junior High School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a discussion, a family discussion when you enlisted
in the Marines, or prior to your enlisting in the Marines, as to your doing so,
and quitting high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was of your own volition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you talk to your mother in advance about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had anything preceded in the way of family discussion of your
brother John's entry into the Coast Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel like it was, sir. He had <span class="locked">previously&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>He had previously, before going into the Coast Guard, joined the Marine
Corps Reserve, the base of which was, at that time, at Grand Prairie, Tex. I believe
it was 105 Howitzer, something like that. And he was perhaps in that
4 or 5 months before he joined the Coast Guard. When it came up about the
Coast Guard, I believe we all talked about it, or at least he talked to Lee about
it in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You used an expression, "I believe we talked about it." Is it
your recollection that you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Nothing that I remember particular about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the character of the discussion, Mr. Oswald? You
had a family in which your mother was having some difficulty supporting
you boys? You had a brother who needed to be supported. Was there any
discussion&mdash;or was there a discussion of what would happen in the event that
first John and then you joined the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe reflecting on what mother said to me when I made
my decision to join the Marine Corps was that perhaps it was the best thing,
where I would not be a burden to her to that extent, and also perhaps be able
to help her when she needed help. And I think this would be in line with
what was said when John left for the Coast Guard, that this would be, of course,
one less for her to take care of at the house, to feed and to clothe, and so forth.
And it would relieve her of her responsibility along that line&mdash;it would help
her, because of the limited amount of funds that she had coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever make an allotment of any portion of your service
pay to your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To your knowledge, did John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were single at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother John was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1952?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he entered the Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When he entered the Coast Guard he was single.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he marry while he was in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was he in the Coast Guard when he married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it he did leave the Coast Guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he enter into military service when he left the Coast
Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did. He transferred from the Coast Guard into
the U.S. Air Force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this to be around 1955. I believe it would be accurate
to say in 1954. I do recall a letter from John to the extent that he lost a
stripe when he transferred from one service to the other, and I believe this letter
came to me when I was in Korea, which was 1954 and early '55. I believe
it was 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you were in Korea, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you say, if you did, that your brother John married?
Do you recall the year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this would be late 1950 or '51.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was during the period you were working at the A&amp;P?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was he stationed at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Staten Island, I guess.</p>

<p>I would like to ask some questions about that later on, but I prefer now
to return to this.</p>

<p>You enlisted in the Marines, then, in the summer of 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. July 11, 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give us in very short compass your military
career?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I went to boot camp at San Diego, Calif., and from San
Diego I went to combat training at Camp Pendleton, Calif. When I left Camp
Pendleton, I was transferred from the infantry into the Marine Air Wing.</p>

<p>I went to Jacksonville, Fla. to a preparatory school down there in Marine
aviation&mdash;more or less to determine your ability and what your strong points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
were, and what field you would be best qualified in the aviation division.</p>

<p>From Jacksonville, Fla., I went into Millington, Tenn., right outside
of Memphis, Tenn., a Navy school, where for approximately 6 months I
attended metalsmith school.</p>

<p>From Memphis, Tenn., or Millington, Tenn., I went to Miami, Fla. for
approximately 9 months. I was not in school any longer. I was on the
job. And from Miami, I was sent overseas to Korea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long were you overseas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 18 months, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From when to when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I reported to Santa Ana, Calif. in January or February
of 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were discharged from the <span class="locked">Marines&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. July of 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you had a full 3 years in the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During that 3-year period, what contact did you have with
the members of your family, and with particular reference, if you can give
that first, with your brother Lee&mdash;his writing you, you writing him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we were corresponding infrequently, I would say&mdash;not
very many letters between I and Lee direct when I was in the service,
especially the first part of my tour in the service.</p>

<p>In 1952, after traveling from Camp Pendleton, Calif., to Jacksonville, Fla.,
I did have a 10-day leave. They were in New York City at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was then some time in 1953, I take it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1952?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. This <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean your mother and Lee&mdash;that is the period of time
they were in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not at that time. I spent my leave in Fort Worth,
because I did not feel I had enough time to travel to New York and down to
Jacksonville, Fla. After completing metalsmith school at Millington, Tenn.,
I took a 10-day leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was July or August of 1953. I had my orders to go
to Miami, Fla. I took a 10-day leave and left Millington, Tenn., by car
and came to New York City and spent 10 days in New York with Lee, mother,
John, and his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At mother's apartment, with Lee, in the Bronx some place&mdash;I
do not recall the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What, if anything, did you learn at that time regarding Lee's
attendance or nonattendance in school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Nothing on that, sir. This was in the summer time. Lee,
of course, was home and not supposed to be in school. And I do not think
anything was brought up that I recall about whether or not Lee had been
attending school regularly or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Can we go off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Referring to the 10-day leave in New York City, did you
spend time with your brother Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother was working during that period of time, was
she not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In spending time with him, did you take him around, or
accompany him, visiting various places in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He took me around, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion during that period to take any photographs,
snapshots, of Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I certainly can identify the one appearing in Life&mdash;yes,
sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just hold your answers right in this area exactly to my questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these taken with your camera, or was it a camera that
your mother or brother owned or had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was my camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What do these questions refer to? Do they refer to the pictures
in Life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I really did not want to refer to that at the moment.</p>

<p>Do you remember any of the places at which you took snapshots of Lee during
this 10-day leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The Bronx Zoo I believe was about the only time I can recall
taking any pictures of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am at liberty to advise you, Mr. Oswald, that when your mother
testified before the Commission she did produce a number of photographs, snapshots,
and otherwise, among which was a snapshot of your brother, Lee, taken
at the New York Zoo&mdash;that she testified was taken at the New York Zoo.</p>

<p>Is that the incident in which you took the photograph of your brother Lee, as
far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You say the New York Zoo, sir. As far as I know there is just
one zoo up there referred to as the Bronx Zoo. I do recall, and I still have the
picture that I took of Lee at the Bronx Zoo. I certainly feel that perhaps either
I sent copies of it to mother, or to Lee after I had the film developed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I go off the record a moment?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record, I have before me the February 21,
1964, issue of Life magazine, on pp. 68-A, 68-B, and 70 of which there appear
a number of photographs. I think it would be well if we gave this spread page
an exhibit number. And since it really consists of two separate pages&mdash;the next
exhibit numbers are what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 281 and 282.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will mark 68-B as 281 and page 69 as 282.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibits Nos. 281 and 282,
respectively, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner&mdash;the only thing you are offering to the Commission
at this time as I understand it are the pictures that appear on those two
pages and not the text.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Directing your attention to page 69, identified as Commission Exhibit 282,
there is a picture of a young boy and the background looks like it might be
taken in a zoo. You mentioned that you had taken a snapshot of your brother
on this 10-day leave.</p>

<p>Could you examine that and see if you can identify that as being the snapshot
you took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I do so identify that picture. That was taken at the
Bronx Zoo&mdash;a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald, taken during my 10-day leave in
New York City in 1953, approximately July or August of 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was school in session at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, school was not in session at that time. This was during
the summer months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So there was no obligation on the part of your brother to have
been in school at this particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, appearing immediately above that snapshot is a snapshot
or a photograph, a picture of two boys. Do you recognize either or both of
those children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do. I recognize the young boy standing, and I recognize
him to be Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who is the boy appearing lower in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recognize him, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is in the upper right hand corner of Commission Exhibit
282. Appearing immediately to the left&mdash;but before I proceed to that, are you
able to identify that sufficiently to indicate to us the age of your brother at the
time that picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say he was approximately 11 or 12 years old at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at this time he was residing where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If he was 11 years old at the time the photograph was taken,
he was residing in Fort Worth, Tex. If he was 12 years old, he would be residing
in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the left appears another photograph of a young man in a
striped shirt, a striped T-shirt. Do you observe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is apparently a blowup from a group picture. Who is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize him to be my brother, Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recognize the clothing, have you seen him in that
clothing before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I recall. The tennis shoes look familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And are you able to make out the age of your brother at the time
this picture was taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say approximately 10 or 11 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So if it were at age 10, he would have been residing where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have already given the age.</p>

<p>To the left of that picture is another photograph or apparently a snapshot.
I notice that there are part of some persons behind the central figure. Do you
recognize the figure in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize it to be Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At what age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Seven or eight years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And assuming age 7, where was he residing at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be&mdash;the year when he was 7 would be 1946 or 1947.
He would be residing in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if he were 8, he still would be residing in Fort Worth,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the left of that picture is a picture of&mdash;I don't know whether
that is one snapshot or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is one, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Showing three persons, three children. Are you able to identify
all three?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please identify and give the ages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Left to right, I identify myself at the age of 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the sailor hat on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With the sailor hat on, right. In the center I identify it to be
Lee Harvey Oswald at the age of 5. On the far right I identify John Edward
Pic at the age of 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you boys were residing where at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Dallas, Tex., on Victor Street. That was taken right outside,
at the side of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the circumstances under which the picture was
taken?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; other than we wanted to take some pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your present recollection is who took the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the background is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The house that we lived in on Victor Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a spread picture at the bottom of the double page.
Are you familiar with the area which is shown in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is on the playground of Ridglea West Elementary School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recognize any of the persons shown in that reproduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify those, if any, you so recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only person I recognize in this photograph is this young
man right here&mdash;I do not recall his name&mdash;I believe his name was Donald.
He lived right around the corner from us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, I hand you a brush pen. Would you indicate by
an arrow the person to whom you made reference? Thank you.</p>

<p>Would you do the same on the picture identified in the extreme upper right
hand corner on Exhibit 282.</p>

<p>Now, I notice on the spread picture at the bottom of the page, which was
identified as a schoolmate, that there is to the left of that picture a picture with
an imprinted arrow. Do you recognize the person to whom the arrow is
pointing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you able to say whether that is or is not your brother Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; from this picture, I cannot determine if it is Lee or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you able to see it clearly enough to say that it is not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not able to see it clearly enough to make a positive
statement one way or the other. It appears to be a little fuzzy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have an opinion as to whether it is or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just do not recognize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I just do not recognize it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now on page 68-A, which we will mark as Commission Exhibit No. 283&mdash;do
you recognize that photograph depicted on that page?</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 283 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you seen the original of that reproduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I most certainly have. I might add that I wore that
same baby suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is shown in that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And John Edward did, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, turning to pages 70 and 71, which we will have marked
as Commission Exhibit 284, so far as page 70 is concerned, and page 71 marked
as 285.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked respectively Commission Exhibits
Nos. 284 and 285 for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spread across page 70 and partially on page 71 is a photograph,
or a reproduction of a photograph.</p>

<p>Do you recognize any of the persons depicted on that spread page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recognize more than one person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And which one do you recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the foreground on the left-hand side, on page 70, I recognize
that to be Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the boy with the V-shaped design on his sweater or
T-shirt, with his hand on his chest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify that by an arrow.</p>

<p>Are you able to, in looking at that&mdash;to tell at what age that was taken,
and where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say approximately 14 years old. I cannot recognize
the classroom there. At 14 Lee would have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was in New York City, was he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1953, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On page 72, which we will mark as Commission Exhibit 286,
there is a photograph or reproduction of a photograph in the lower right-hand
corner.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 286 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize anyone in that reproduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize both people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you indicate the person you recognize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize the person on the left-hand side of this photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I recognize him to be Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At about what age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Since I am aware of where this picture was taken, at the
age of 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you <span class="locked">elaborate&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am aware where this picture was taken. This is in Arlington
Heights High School. I believe this exhibit right behind him in the
background was on the third floor of Arlington Heights High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was taken at the high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was of what age at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it is pretty clear, since there is a gentleman and a lady
in this picture, the only two persons indicated, and you have identified your
brother&mdash;would you still, however, put a arrow pointing to your brother.
Thank you.</p>

<p>Turning to page 74-A, which is Commission Exhibit 287, there are two
pictures reproduced in the lower right-hand corner.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 287 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you state what they are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Both pictures are pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he appears to be in military garb. Were those taken
when he was in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, did you see him in his service uniform at any
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recognize these pictures as depicting your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On pages 74 and 75 of Life Magazine, which will be Commission
Exhibits 288 and 289, there is a spread picture.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit Nos. 288 and
289, respectively, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize any of the persons depicted in that spread
picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do, but only one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Identify the one you recognize, and locate it in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize Lee Harvey Oswald being in the foreground of the picture,
approximately in the center of the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify him with this brush pencil?</p>

<p>Then on Exhibit 288, which is page 74-B of this issue of Life Magazine,
there appears at the bottom a reproduction of identity cards. I direct your
attention to the left-hand identity card upon which appears a photograph, a
reproduction of a photograph. Do you recognize that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would have to say that he appears heavier, his face is fuller,
he has more hair on his head, but the eyes and the nose and the mouth are
Lee Harvey Oswald's. I had not studied that picture before. But he does
seem to be quite fullfaced, if that is the terminology to use there, and much
more hair on his head&mdash;there again in relation to the hair I am assuming here
this photograph of Lee was taken after he returned from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would rather not have you assume anything at the moment.</p>

<p>Do you identify that as a reproduction of a picture of your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with&mdash;were you at the time acquainted with
the circumstances under which there was issued or purported to be issued a
Selective Service System classification card in the name of Alek James Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you ever have a discussion with your brother with
respect to his use, if he did, of the name Alek James Hidell, A.&nbsp;J. Hidell, or any
combination of that, in which the surname Hidell was employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. And if I may say, at no time have I ever
known him to use any other name than Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, you are unacquainted with any circumstances
under which he employed, if he did employ at any time, the surname Hidell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any other alias?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever know him to employ an alias?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever employed one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Off the record, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will withdraw that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is what it amounts to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Let me state this for the purposes of the record. In order
to avoid publicity or avoid newsmen, we did travel to Friendship Airport from
Dallas, Texas, yesterday evening, February 19th, and Robert Oswald traveled
under the name of F.&nbsp;M. Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the following page, which is page 76, Commission Exhibit
290, is a photograph, reproduction of a photograph in the lower right-hand
corner.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 290 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recognize the person depicted in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize the two people in the photograph&mdash;the woman being
Mrs. Marina Oswald, and the man being Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever seen that picture before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see it prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I did, and the reason why I say I believe&mdash;I
believe I either have a copy of this photograph myself, or one very, very similar
to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you come into the possession of the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee had sent it to me from Russia, showed me pictures of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
and his wife on their wedding day in April, 1961. I received the photographs,
though, in approximately May, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you still have those photographs in your possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do. If I may say, I did turn over I believe four
photographs that Lee had sent me from Russia, and I believe in all four photographs
Lee and Marina were in them. And I turned these over to Mr. Jim H.
Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they are your personal property.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to get into that period of time when you were in correspondence
with your brother at a later moment.</p>

<p>Turning now to page 78, which is Commission Exhibit 291, in the lower left-hand
corner of that is a reproduction, or what purports to be a reproduction of
a photograph.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 291 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize either of the two persons depicted in that
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I recognize the man on the right with the piece of
paper in his hand, and a notebook I believe under his left arm, to be Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize the other man who is partially shown in that
photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see that photograph at any time prior to November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on page 80, which is Commission Exhibit No. 292, there
are two photographs, one showing a lady and a child, in the upper right-hand
corner.</p>

<p>(The material referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 292 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to that picture first, do you recognize
either of the persons shown in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do. I recognize both persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify them, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The child is June Lee Oswald, and the woman is Mrs. Marina
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And June Oswald is your brother's child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you seen that photograph at any time prior to November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the lower right-hand corner is a photograph of a man holding
a firearm or rifle with a pistol on his right hip and some papers of some kind
in&mdash;he is holding the rifle in his left hand, the papers in his right hand. Do you
recognize the person depicted in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do. I recognize him to be my brother, Lee Harvey
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you seen that photograph at any time prior to November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you seen the photograph of which that is a reproduction
since November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Under what circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Inn of the Six Flags at Arlington. Tex., approximately
November 27, 1963, in the presence of U.S. Secret Service and Marina Oswald
and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Your mother was not there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She was there at the time, but I do not believe she was in the
room when this photograph was shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits 281
through 292 the pages of the issue of Life Magazine I have identified that bear
those exhibit numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. I understand counsel for Mr. Oswald has pointed out that
I believe you are offering only the photographs and not the text?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, sir. May I amend my offer. I offer in evidence
the reproduction of photographs which the witness has identified that appear on
Commission Exhibits 281 through 292.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They may be accepted.</p>

<p>(The portion of the documents heretofore marked Commission Exhibits Nos.
281 through 292 for identification were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I do not offer any of the text or any other portions of those pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is so noted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are there any other events or happenings or circumstances during
this 10-day period in New York City that come to your mind? You have told
of the incident of taking the photograph which was identified. You told of
visiting various places in New York City and being with your brother Lee.
Was it a good deal during this 10-day period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; practically every day, and practically every night, with
two exceptions at night, where my brother John fixed me up with a blind date
for one night only&mdash;no, I take that back. It would be just one night Lee was not
with me, and that would be on the night I had a blind date with a girl from New
York City, with my brother John and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and your brother Lee visit your brother John's home
during this 10-day stay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion with your brother Lee&mdash;put it this
way&mdash;did you become aware during this 10-day period as to whether your
mother and brother had stayed with your brother John at any time during their
New York visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. It was my understanding that when they first arrived
in New York for a brief period they stayed together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion with you as to why they left the home
of your brother John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to any extent&mdash;no, sir, no discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion of any difficulties or any incidents that had arisen
while they were living with your brother John's family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That induced or had a bearing upon leaving and taking an
apartment in the Bronx?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know of any discussion or any difficulty that was mentioned
to me, but I understand there was some difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, Mr. Oswald&mdash;the subject was not discussed with you
during the 10-day period you were on leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it discussed with you at any time prior to November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion on the subject of your brother's progress
in schooling in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject of his attendance at school, whether the attendance
was good or bad&mdash;was school discussed at all, as you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as a layman, and acquainted with your brother, what was
your impression? Give us your present impression of your brother's state of
mind during that 10-day period. Was he normal and happy and friendly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was very normal. He did not appear to be unhappy. He was
quite happy to see me. We spent a good deal of time together during that 10-day
visit. At no time did he act abnormally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he complain to you about school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In general did he complain about anything&mdash;any special gripes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that as being a happy 10-day visit on your 10-day
leave in New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Both you and your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you spend time with your mother as well as your brother Lee
during the 10-day period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be when&mdash;the evenings and on Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Generally in the evenings. That is the way I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and your brother Lee and your mother&mdash;did you do any
visiting during the evening, movies, any entertainment, go out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; Lee and I did. Mother did not join us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of your mother's state of mind and
well-being and her general feeling while you were there during that 10-day
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have that again, please?</p>

<p>(The reporter read the pending question.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My impression of my mother at that time was that she was still
having a little difficulty making enough money to have the things that she
wanted to have, I should say. But generally her health was good, and nothing
that I recall comes to mind that would indicate that there was any difficulty
between her and Lee. They seemed to be getting along quite well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your impression during the 10-day period, I take it then, was
that the relationship between your mother and Lee was friendly, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there any arguments during the time you were there
between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he at any time during that period&mdash;was he discourteous to
his mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may in my own words here, <span class="locked">sir&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The word "discourteous"&mdash;my mother did not wish us to go to
certain places&mdash;I say certain places&mdash;I do not recall the places. She just did
not want us going, inasmuch as we were going during the day. I wanted to see
as much of New York as I could while I was there. And I recall that Lee and
mother and I had something of an argument in reference to staying away from
the house during the day so long, and so forth. And it was not her wish that
we do that. And if this was being discourteous&mdash;that is why I qualify that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing extraordinary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your leave terminated. You went back to Florida, and you
eventually wound up in Korea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question before we leave the New York period?</p>

<p>While you were there, was there any discussion about these absences from
school which I think took place just the months before you were there&mdash;although
I am not absolutely clear on that. It seems to me as I understand it your
mother and Lee arrived in the Bronx area around September of '52, I think
it was, and this was in the summer of '53 that you visited them there, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So that according to what I recall&mdash;and this may not be accurate&mdash;what
is referred to as the truancy, the 46 days absence from school, had
occurred some time prior to your visit. Maybe you do not recall that. That
did not come up at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No; it did not come up at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did anything come up about a psychiatric examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. There was no mention of the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. So the psychiatric examination was not mentioned in your
presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It had taken place I think in May of 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir&mdash;mother did mention that Lee had appeared before
a judge, and she said it was a Negro judge. I asked why, and she said because
he had been absent from school too long, no specific dates or length of time was
mentioned, and that they were stricter in New York about that than in Texas.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did this bother her, disturb her? Did she indicate the
reaction to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;at that time I do not recall any reaction that she had,
or any comment she made about it. She just very briefly stated that he had
appeared before this Negro judge in New York City, and just what I previously
related about it. That was the only thing she said about it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She did not mention a man named Carro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; nobody's name was mentioned, not even the judge's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your present recollection, that is about all that
occurred in the way of conversation respecting some possible truancy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all you now can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were mustered out of the Marines in July of 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you return&mdash;well, when you were mustered out, where did
you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where were your mother and brother living at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you still single?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain why you went to Fort Worth, Tex., rather
than to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I considered Fort Worth, Tex., my home. I wanted to go there.
I had quite a few friends. I wanted to find a job in Fort Worth, Tex. And
that is where I wanted to live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did undertake residence there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you continued to be a resident of Fort Worth, Tex., ever
since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Indicate in short compass where you have resided since you got
out of the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From 1955 I resided in Fort Worth, Tex., until March of 1963.
From March of 1963 until September 1963, I resided in Malvern, Ark. And from
September until present date I have resided in Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit your mother and your brother in New Orleans
when you returned from the service in July of 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did. I did not&mdash;yes, sir, it was in July 1955 when I
made my first trip from Fort Worth, Tex., to New Orleans, La. I had purchased
a car the second day I was home from the service, a 1951 Chevrolet, and
I drove it on the third day or the second night to New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were your quarters in a hotel, or did you join your brother and
mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I joined my mother and brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you stay in New Orleans on that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 1 week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you lived with your mother and brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in July of 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not in school at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, how did you find your brother, as to the state of health and
state of mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He seemed to be the same to me. He had joined at that time&mdash;no,
sir&mdash;he had not at that time been in the Civil Air Patrol. At that time Lee
was working I believe for an export firm there in New Orleans. I do not know
the name of it. I do not believe I ever heard the name of it. I might have.
Mother was also working at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you seen your brother in the interim&mdash;that is the interim
between the 10-day leave in New York City and your return from Korea in
July of 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was one leave, or perhaps it was this time in 1955 that
Lee was in the Civil Air Patrol there in New Orleans, because I remember his
uniform that he had. And we went out to lunch on a Sunday afternoon. And
he had his uniform on&mdash;mother, he, and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Robert, he asked you this&mdash;if between the time you went
to New York City and left there, and the time you went to Korea and came back,
and you were mustered out of the Marine Corps, did you see your brother at
any time during that period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I recall now. Leaving Miami, Fla., in 1954&mdash;January
or February&mdash;I took another 10-day leave, I believe it was, and I traveled to
New Orleans first, where mother and Lee was, and at this time he was in the
Civil Air Patrol. And I spent 3 or 4 days there in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You stayed with your mother and brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When you come to a good place, Mr. Jenner, we will stop for
5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Commission's convenience is my convenience.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. May I ask one or two questions.</p>

<p>Your brother John&mdash;is he alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Where is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. San Antonio, Tex., in the U.S. Air Force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He is a half brother.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. He is your older brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How old is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He is 32 now.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You never had any problems in school or in the Marine
Corps, did you&mdash;I mean serious problems?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; no serious problems.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You always had problems. But you never were in any
trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never been in any serious trouble in my life.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Ever been arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. The only time I was on the inside of a jail was one time
in Hazel, Tex., when I refused to sign a traffic ticket on the spot and I requested
to be taken to the courthouse.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you ever have any psychiatric mental troubles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you consider your brother a normal human being?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I most certainly did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. In every way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In every way.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he ever give you any indications of being&mdash;did he
ever discuss with you such things as shooting at General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. In order to clear something up, Mr. Boggs, let me ask one question,
if I may, for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Please. Do you want this on the record or off?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Robert, from the time that your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald
came back from Russia, when was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was in June 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And then when was the next time that you saw him after he
came to your home in Fort Worth, Tex., in June of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just after he returned from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I saw him on a number of occasions there in Fort Worth, Tex.,
after he moved out of my residence to mother's, from mother's apartment to his
apartment with Marina, and the children, and when they moved to Dallas, Tex.,
that was the last time I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. When did he move to Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was approximately October 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right, from the time of October 1962, when was&mdash;from
then when was the next time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Dallas County Jail or Dallas City Jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It was the Dallas City Jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Dallas City Jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. What were those circumstances? Were you in a room
with him or were you talking to him through a partition or over a telephone or
what, explain that to the Commission, if you will?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was talking to him over a telephone through a glass window,
and he was on the locked side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. So for a period of over a year from the time he left Fort Worth
and moved to Dallas, Tex., you did not see him, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. When you last saw him was October 1962, is that
what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And you had previously seen him when he resided in your
home for how long a period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 6 to 8 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I imagine this would be covered later but it fits in. I think
you are quite right. I have a question or two.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I have to go back to the House in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Go right ahead. Ask him any questions you wish to.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. At the time he resided in your home these 6 or 8 weeks
were your relations with him cordial or friendly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was cordial, yes, more or less like he had not been to Russia.
We were just together again.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you have any political discussions with him at
any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. He never discussed political matters with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not. I would say we had a tacit agreement it was
never brought up.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. By tacit, do you mean <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. An unspoken agreement that we never would discuss it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I understand. Had you arrived at this agreement because
on previous occasions you had disagreed about political matters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that was not the reason. We just never discussed
politics.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you have any interest in political affairs, I
<span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A little bit, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I mean from a philosophical point of view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My own interest in politics from a philosophical point of view
would be that I considered myself a conservative, a born conservative. Certainly
agreed 100 percent with the U.S. Constitution and the laws that are set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
forth, and it is my upbringing, it is what I always believed in and I will always
believe in it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you say that was your mother's philosophy, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No, sir; he did not say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Would I say that?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say&mdash;I will tell you, at this present time I feel like perhaps
she has been hurt a great deal and perhaps her thinking is being changed
at this very moment and at the present time since November 22d.</p>

<p>But prior to that time my opinion would be that she would be of the same
opinion that I was.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. That is why you said your attitude was based on your
upbringing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Of course, to qualify that my mother didn't actually
bring me up too much. The orphan home and the military academy, and I believe
there my basic philosophy was formulated. It was a very good school.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What military academy was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Chamberlain Hunt Military Academy at Port Gibson, Miss.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. During the 6 or 8 weeks that Lee resided in your home,
did he ever indicate why he went to Russia? You must have talked about it
some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There again I believe we did more talking through the mails
about why he went to Russia than we did when he returned from Russia. I,
of course, wanted to talk to him about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You have those letters, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we have those letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Those letters have already been given to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will present them in evidence, I think probably this afternoon.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he ever tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not point blank did he ever tell me why he went to
Russia.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did he tell you why he came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that he was in&mdash;the letters that I have from him while
he was in Russia would indicate the same thing, that he was very unhappy
living in Russia and he wanted to return to the United States, which, of course,
made me very happy, and I felt like, and tried to look at it from the standpoint
that maybe he just sowed some wild oats. He kind of went off to the far end
of it, but I believe everyone of us at one time, especially around that age, might
have done something or reached out far afield, so to speak, before we came to
our senses and returned to a normal life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he seem different when he came back from Russia, was there
a change in the man before and after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Physically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No, I mean at all&mdash;changes, outlook, attitude and <span class="locked">general&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The mental attitude he had from his letters that he wrote me
when he first arrived in Russia were quite disturbing to me. Statements,
various statements, I can't quote them word for word, but in the line of&mdash;well, he
wanted to denounce his citizenship. He was a Marxist and he was a Communist
and he wanted to stay in Russia, and so forth.</p>

<p>But when he started writing again in 1961&mdash;yes, 1961, his letters certainly
indicated that he had changed his mind, and that he wanted to return to the
United States and start his life as a U.S. citizen.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You got to know Mrs. Oswald when she returned with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was the relationship between your family and your
wife and Mrs. Oswald, of course, I realize you had a language barrier, but was
it pleasant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I would describe it as very pleasant. We immediately,
my wife and I both, took to Marina and June, the baby, at that time, and my
wife and I both were just tickled to death, so to speak, for an opportunity to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
with somebody like Marina and to show her things that she had never seen
before in her life.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. In the time, of course, you had known her ever since
she came here, and you have seen her since the assassination of President
Kennedy, have you had any feeling that she was anything other than a normal
housewife? You know there has been speculation that in light of the fact she
was born in Russia and that she got an exit visa without too much difficulty
that maybe she had connections that were not entirely just that of a normal
housewife. Did you ever have any <span class="locked">feeling&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only time I had any reservations about Marina Oswald
was on Friday, November 22, until approximately 2 days later. I say during this
2-day period I was not sure whether or not she had been involved in any of the
happenings of that date. I wanted not to believe that she did, but I wanted to
be cautious about it. I believe on Sunday night, November 24, in my presence
she gave a complete&mdash;and freely stated everything up to that time that she was
aware of to the U.S. Secret Service on a tape recorder. And I formulated my
opinion then that apparently, and I feel this way now, that she did not have
anything to do with that, and she is nothing other than just what she appears
to be, just a housewife, having a very difficult time at this time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Have you in your own mind reached any conclusions on
whether or not your brother killed President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Based on the circumstantial evidence that has been reported in
newspapers and over the radio and television, I would have to say that it appears
that he did kill President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Would you, having reached that conclusion under the
circumstances that you outlined a moment ago, and having known him all of his
life, although not too intimately the last year of his life, would you give us
any reason for why he may have done this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I could not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. It came as, I would think, a great shock to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it certainly did, and I might add that the Lee Harvey
Oswald that I knew would not have killed anybody.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Have you discussed this matter with your stepbrother
since it happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This, as I understand, Mr. Counsel, is hearsay but we
are just trying to <span class="locked">establish&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Boggs, in order that the record be absolutely clear, you
were not here when we commenced this morning due to your duties at the House,
let me state this for the purpose of the record and yourself and the entire
Commission, you ask Robert Oswald any question that you want to ask him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And furthermore, any information we have or any information
we can get from any source will likewise be turned over to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation or to this Commission or to any other investigative agency,
<span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. The mandate that we are operating under is that we
discover the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I can assure you, sir, that the main reason that we are here,
and I speak for Robert Oswald, is to see that the truth is given fully, and developed
as fully as possible, to give any light to this tragic event.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I just have one or two other questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe your last question was whether or <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I am frankly reluctant to ask you the question, but
you and your brother John must have speculated about how this event could
have happened, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, and no, sir. To this extent: On Sunday night November 24,
with the help of the Secret Service, I was able to reach my older brother John
by telephone. He did not have a telephone in his house. We had to go through
the Air Force base where he was located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was he living then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In San Antonio with the Air Force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
I talked to him that night and, of course, at that time he was aware that Lee
had been killed. I talked briefly to him, I say briefly, perhaps 4 or 5 minutes,
and discussed with him whether or not he thought it was best that he attended
the funeral or not, and it was my opinion that it would not be best for him or
his family since he was, his name was Pic, and to a great extent he would be
out of the picture and there was no sense in exposing him to the publicity of
the funeral. Not to mention the travel time involved in coming up from San
Antonio and the like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were not in touch with him between the time of the assassination
and the arrest of your brother and the time of his death, the 36 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You were not in touch with your brother Pic at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. But you attempted to reach him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You did afterwards.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Have you seen much of your mother since the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Is this because you had some emotional problems or
difficulties, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I would say, of course, mother was out at the Inn of Six
Flags with Marina and myself and the children during the week following up to
Friday which would be, I believe, the 29th of November, when she went to her
home and I left her to go after my wife and the children out at the farm, and
Marina went over to Mr. Martin's house, this was the last time I have seen her
since then. She has called quite a few times. I talked to her a number of times
on the telephone. She is rather persistent to the extent that, and this is not
new to me, we have never really gotten along, she tries to dominate me and my
wife, and I might say that applies to John and his family, and also to the extent
that it applied to Lee and his wife, and there is just generally the picture as
far as I and my mother are concerned.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. That is all, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The testimony we had here from Mrs. Oswald indicated that it
was approximately a year prior to the assassination of the President that he
had not been in touch with his mother, and your testimony is to the general
effect that about the same period, you had not been in touch.</p>

<p>Is that just a coincidence, or did something happen about that time so that
both of you, both brothers more or less separated from the mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, <span class="locked">sir&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Maybe it is geographic, maybe there is some other reason for it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I had understood him to say he had not been in contact
with his brother Lee, I didn't hear him say anything about his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct. For the year prior to November 22d had you
been in touch with your mother or had your mother been in touch with you,
Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; we had not been in touch.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Your mother in her testimony before the Commission,
gave the impression and later in press stories that she thought that maybe your
brother was an agent of the CIA. Did you ever have any reason to think that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; and the only time the thought ever entered my mind
as to him being an agent of the CIA or any other U.S. Government bureau was
on his return from Russia while residing at my residence in Fort Worth, the
FBI had called and requested that he come down for an interview there in Fort
Worth. On the completion of his interview when I came home from work that
night, he discussed it briefly and I asked him how did they treat him, and so
forth. He said just fine, and he says, "They asked me was I a secret agent," or
some type of agent for the U.S. Government and he laughed and he said, "Well,
don't you know?" I remember that. That was just crossed out of my mind.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Between November 22 and the last time you saw your
mother did she ever mention to you that she thought Lee was an agent of the
Federal Government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was prior to November 22?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, from November 22 until the last time you saw your
mother, did she ever mention to you that she thought Lee was an agent of the
Federal Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she did.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Can you tell us when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During the middle to the latter part of the week that we were
at the Inn of the Six Flags, and at least one conversation since we left the Inn
of the Six Flags, I think it took place during December 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By telephone or personal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By telephone, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough to relate&mdash;for Representative Ford&mdash;who
was present, what the circumstances were, what was said, and in the presence
of whom by your mother at the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe it was just mother and I, and I might say on numerous
occasions she pulled me to one side or to one room to say something to me. It
was on one of these occasions that she was talking to me about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Relate as closely as you can recall it now what did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She said she had knowledge of facts in writing that almost conclusively
proved to her that Lee was an agent of the CIA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she identify the facts in writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of her on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ask her to state to you the basis, any specific basis of hers
on which she predicated her statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did ask her if she had such facts to please give it to
the U.S. Secret Service.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What did she say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I think she more or less shrugged her shoulders and walked off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had she been in touch with the man who has appeared as her
counsel at that time, Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She had not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You at various times have tried to help your mother, I
gather, while you were growing up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I gather you found it rather difficult even when you
were younger to get along with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir, is that also true of your brother, Lee, and your
brother, John?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Those were the questions I was about to ask.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say this would also apply to my older brother John,
and also to Lee. It appears as though Lee was able to put up with her more
than I or my older brother John could.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Your father died when you were what, about 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Five years old, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You were living in New Orleans when he died?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of
New Orleans, in the office in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were your mother and father living a happy normal
life at the time of his death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, sir, I was 5 years old and I would say that they were.
Certainly I do not recall any instance that would indicate that they were not,
and I think we had a very fine family atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state for us, please, on the same subject, the life and
relationship between your mother and Mr. Ekdahl, give us the same thing with
respect to that period, did they get along well normally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I was, of course, older and perhaps remember more, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
this extent that on perhaps two or three occasions, I recall some very loud
arguments where they were in one room with the door closed, and perhaps
I by myself or perhaps in the presence of John was in another room. Nothing
that I can recall that was said during this arguing other than it was just loud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this period, Representative Boggs, the two boys John
and Robert were at the military school. They were home during the summer
vacation period but otherwise they were in military school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think maybe we ought to give the witness a little rest. He
has been on for 2 hours.</p>

<p>Hale, have you got anything more you want to ask now?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. No, I would just like to thank the witness for his
cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you have anything? Do you have to go back?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. I am going to stay until we get some notice from the
House if we have any call or a vote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Shall we take just 5 minutes off then and it might be agreeable.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Proceed, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. It would be helpful because we are likely to get a call
almost any time to go back to the House, if I could ask a few questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Oswald, what was your reaction to Lee's discharge
from the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had an honorable discharge he told me. I had no adverse
reaction to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have in mind, Representative Ford, the change in the
status of that discharge?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. No, I was referring to the circumstances under which he
was discharged prematurely. He did get an honorable discharge at the outset
but he was released prematurely on a hardship basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Were you familiar with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was not familiar with that at the time it was going on. Of
course, I was familiar after he was released on that basis. I remember Lee
telling me, he said, "Well, I only lack a month," or a few days anyway before
his regular release was up and I believe that was all that was said between Lee
and I about it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When did you learn about the change in his discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sometime during the year of 1960, through my mother. She
had advised me at that time she had received mail for Lee from the Marine
Corps or from the Navy Department, stating that generally the reasons he had
not notified them of changes of address, and perhaps even to the extent
that he had left the country in the manner that he did, that it was going to go
before a review board, and that he was to appear before this board to state his
case, otherwise it would proceed without him. Then I became aware that the
board's decision was an undesirable or a dishonorable discharge, I don't recollect
which.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you take any action when you learned of these
circumstances to help your mother or to contact Lee about this situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; because at this time in reference to Lee there he had
already stopped writing to both I and mother and there was no way that we
knew of to contact Lee, and mother said she was going to take care of it and
try to have it postponed or something or other, and the board reached a final
decision.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. When your mother went to Washington, did she tell
you in advance or give you any indication she was going to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not. I was aware of it after she came back from
Washington.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she fill you in in some detail about her return from
Washington?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> No, sir; she did not. She did not go into any particular detail
other than she tried to impress on me she had seen some, as she put it, some
very important and influential people in Washington. And that was about
the text of the conversation in reference to that.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> Did she volunteer this or did you ask her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She volunteered this because I did not know of the trip to
Washington until after she returned from the trip to Washington. She
volunteered information to me that she had been in Washington and saw numbers
of people, different people.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> The principal information you have about Lee's return
from the Soviet Union is included in the letters that you have from Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> Those will be submitted subsequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. They have been submitted already, Mr. Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, did you address me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The Commission has copies of the letters.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> The Commission has copies and they will be submitted
for the record.</p>

<p>Would you care to comment in addition on what you found out from Lee
subsequently of his experiences in the Soviet Union. Why he wanted to come
back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I never questioned him about that because we covered
it, I believe quite fully in our letters. I was, of course, thoroughly convinced
and quite happy that he did want to return to the United States and I felt
there was no need to go into the reason why he changed his mind because I
believe we had covered that in the letters.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> At the time he indicated a desire to come back to the
United States, did he ever contact you about funds for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I volunteered to help him any way I could on that.
He turned down the offer. He turned it down one time I believe in letters
offering him to come stay at our house when he returned with his wife and the
baby.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> When he did return, after having borrowed money
from the Federal Government, did he ever ask you for any help and assistance in
repaying the loan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On his arrival in New York City, I believe the date to be June 13,
back in 1962, my wife received a telephone call from Special Services Welfare
Center located at New York City stating that Lee and his family were present
and that they needed funds to reach their destination, Fort Worth, Tex., and
the lady that talked to my wife put it to the extent they were unable to help
them and if some member of the family was going to help them, they had better
do so then. My wife didn't know anything else to say but of course that
we would, and this is what I wanted her to say. She called me at my office
that day. The banks had closed but I do have a friend in Fort Worth who
was employed at a bank, cashier, I believe his title, and I called him and
asked him if it would be possible to withdraw $200. This was not at my bank,
I would give him a check on my checking account, and at which time I wired
the money to the welfare bureau in New York, care of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> And that was the money that they, Marina and Lee, used
to get to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> Did Lee ever repay you for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did. He had actually spent a little over $100 for
the plane tickets and, of course, we met him at Dallas, Love Field, on their
arrival there. The next day even though I insisted that he keep it, he returned
what he had left from the $200 and he said he would pay me back as soon as
he was able to and I told him not to worry about that, but just to take his time.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford.</span> How long did it take him to repay the remainder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I say approximately $110 to $115 during the period he first
started to work there in Fort Worth and prior to their departure to Dallas
he repaid this $10-$20 a week from his pay check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you have any knowledge that Lee had become
fluent in Russian, in the Russian language, at the time he came out of the
Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not. There is also one of his first letters from
the hotel in Russia that he pointed out to me that I didn't even know that he
could write or speak Russian. He was being rather sarcastic in his first
letters, and he pointed this out. I would answer it that I was not aware that
he could speak or could write any foreign language when he was in the Marine
Corps and after he got out of it.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You had no prior knowledge that he was studying
Russian or had become articulate in Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In your experiences with Lee during your lifetime,
did he ever show a skill at language, for languages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I know of no time nor can I recall of any time that
he studied any foreign language or in my presence that he even read a book
in a foreign language or attempted to teach himself any type of foreign
language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Representative Ford, if you have reached a break, I would
like to identify the exhibit the witness provided and also identify the letter
to which you now have reference.</p>

<p>Would you obtain that telegram and also identify the date of the letter
to which you have lastly made reference so that I may identify our copies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. November 8, 1959, is the letter, Mr. Jenner, and the telegram
is June 14, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, we have marked photostatic copies of the telegram
to which the witness referred as having been received from the Special
Welfare Services as Commission Exhibit No. 293, and the letter of November 18,
1959, as Commission Exhibit 294.</p>

<p>(The telegram and letter referred to were marked Commission Exhibit Nos.
293 and 294, respectively, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you obtain the original of those or hand the witness the
originals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I have just handed them to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you hand him the original of the letter, please?</p>

<p>Directing your attention to the telegram first, Mr. Oswald, which is now
marked Commission Exhibit 293, is that the original of the telegram to which
you made reference as having been received first by telephone call through your
wife on June 14, <span class="locked">19&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, June 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 13?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. This reply that we are referring to here now is June 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were first contacted on the evening of June 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then, sir, that you received a telephone call on June 13,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or your wife did. And Exhibit 293 which is dated the 14th, is
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Following the receipt of the telephone call on June 13, did you
receive or did you send any communication from or to the New York Welfare
Center?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I sent a telegram on the afternoon of June 13, 1962,
wiring a total of $200 to the Special Service Welfare Center at New York, and
also enclosing a message to Lee to contact me or to the extent that someone
there perhaps would notify me when to expect them in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive word from New York as to when Lee and Marina
might expect to be in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that by telegram or telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was by telephone I first received the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive something in writing that confirmed that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that document before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is marked Commission Exhibit 293, and you actually received
that document which is now before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. June 14.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit 293, the document
so marked and identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be accepted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 293 was received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The letter of November 8, 19&mdash;do you have a better copy, is that
1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I just ask a question, are we putting in the original of
that or is a photographic copy being substituted for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are employing as a substitute for the original a photostatic
copy which has been marked Commission Exhibit 293.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chairman, could I be excused for just a moment, please?</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In view of the witness' testimony, may I suggest to the Commission
the feasibility of identifying this particular exhibit since the witness
referred to it in response to the questions put by Representative Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify the date of Commission Exhibit 294, the
original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The date of the letter is November 8, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose handwriting is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is in Lee Harvey Oswald's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is addressed, the second page of the exhibit, is an envelope,
which is addressed to R. Oswald, 7313 Davenport Street, Fort Worth, Tex.,
U.S.A., is that you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you able to identify that which appears in the upper lefthand
corner of the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that in Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would assume that it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive the letter, Commission Exhibit 294, in due course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did. I received it on the 13th day of November 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this the letter to which you made reference in responding
to Representative Ford's questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the letter in the same condition now and is the envelope now
in the same condition now that it was when you received it except that the
envelope has been opened to remove the contents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that include the scratching out that appears at the bottom
of the second page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that which appears under the attempted obliteration, can
you see what was obliterated on the second page, when you examine the
original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I might refer to the first cross out there, it looks like he had
signed his name there "Lee." The second cross out, one word or three words or
four words out of the five are legible "this written in Russian" the balance of the
words that were crossed out, I cannot make out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest, if I may, that the witness might
read this short letter aloud to the Commission which will, indicate to the Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
the mental state of Lee Harvey Oswald at the time he went to Russia
in the very early days, and bring it to your attention immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is the date of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. November 8, 1959, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Proceed, if you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you mind if I read it, Mr. Jenner, and saving his voice a
little bit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. This I believe is the second letter that Robert received from
Russia after he had sent a telegram to Lee telling him what a mistake he had
made, and this is the contents of the letter.</p>

<p>"November 8, 1959. Dear Robert:</p>

<p>"Well, what shall we talk about? The weather perhaps? Certainly you do
not wish me to speak of my decision to remain in the Soviet Union and apply
for citizenship here since I am afraid you would not be able to comprehend my
reasons.</p>

<p>"You really don't know anything about me. Do you know, for instance, that
I have waited to do this for well over a year? Do you know that I" then
there is a parenthesis and some Russian printing which I presume to be Russian
and the parenthesis is closed, "speak a fair amount of Russian which I have
been studying for many months? I have been told that I will not have to leave
the Soviet Union if I did not care to. This then is my decision. I will not
leave this country, the Soviet Union under any conditions. I will never return
to the United States which is a country I hate. Some day perhaps soon and
then again perhaps in a few years I will become a citizen of the Soviet Union,
but it is a very legal process in any event. I will not have to leave the Soviet
Union and I will never leave.</p>

<p>"I received your telegram and I was glad to hear from you. Only one word
bothered me. The word 'mistake' I assume you mean that I have made a
'mistake.' It is not for you to tell me this. You cannot understand my reasons
for this very serious action. I will not speak to anyone from the United States
over the telephone since it might be tapped by the Americans. If you wish to
correspond with me you can write to the below address, but I really don't see
what we could talk about. If you want to send me some money that I can use
but I do not expect to be able to pay it back."</p>

<p>Then it is signed "Lee", and then over to the left-hand side on the bottom
of the page it says, "Lee Harvey Oswald, Metropole Hotel, Room 233, Moscow,
USSR," and then underneath some writing in Russian, which I take to be
Russian, which is scratched out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. McKenzie, you have stated that this was the second letter that had been
received by Mr. Robert Oswald following Lee Harvey Oswald's taking up residence
in Russia. Is that correct, Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I said it is the second or third letter. I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, it is the first letter, if I may have a moment here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought it was the first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. There is one other letter here from Santa Ana, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was the first letter Lee had written to me from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you refresh my memory as to the date of his arrival in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. October 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. October 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And this <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. November 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. November 8. He had been there about 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first time I was aware he was in Russia was on Halloween
Day 1959, October 31.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. My attention is arrested to that portion of the letter in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
there appears to be a reference to a telegram which you had previously sent
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you sent him such a telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impelled you or induced you to do that? What event,
stimulation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After we were notified that Lee was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who notified you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Star Telegram reporter in Fort Worth, Tex. Later on that
same day there was quite a few newspaper reporters out to my house. I first
objected to speaking to them until they stated that perhaps if we cooperated
with them they would perhaps be the only source of information&mdash;that they
could relay to us when they received anything about what Lee was doing, and
so forth, and I agreed to talk to them.</p>

<p>After this interview with three or four newspaper reporters they had left
the house, and another man, I do not recall his name, from the Star Telegram
in Fort Worth, came to the house, and I spoke with him, and I believe at this
time he suggested that it would not be wise because I was asking what did he
think as to how I might contact Lee, and he suggested a letter&mdash;pardon me, a
telegram, to Secretary of State Christian Herter, and a telegram to Lee.</p>

<p>I called the Western Union and sent telegrams, and at this <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir, telegrams, you sent one to Mr. Herter and one
to your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; sent two. At this time I advised the reporter of the
contents of the telegram. I did not receive confirmation of these telegrams
from Western Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from that you do not have copies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>However, they are printed in their entirety in the next edition of the Star
Telegram, which I believe would be November 1st edition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. November 1, 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please state to the best of your present recollection
what your instruction by way of message was to the Western Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the telegram to Secretary of State Christian Herter, I requested
his assistance in contacting Lee Oswald through any means available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you indicate for what purpose, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't believe I did, sir.</p>

<p>And the telegram to Lee Harvey Oswald, I asked him to contact me through
any means available. I did use the word "mistake."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please give me your best recollection of the message,
as you recall it, that you dispatched or ordered dispatched?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My best recollection of that is I sent the telegram to Lee Harvey
Oswald care of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Russia, requesting Lee to contact
me through any means available, and the one word "mistake. Keep your nose
clean," signed "Robert L. Oswald, 7313 Davenport."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The word "mistake" was by itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct. The phrase of "keep your nose clean,"
is something we have said to each other since knee high, so he would know that
I did send the telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive a response to that telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not receive a response to either one of the telegrams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neither from the State Department, Mr. Herter, nor an assistant
on that telegram, nor from your brother Lee on his telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than the letter of November 8, 1959, now identified as Commission
Exhibit No. 294?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is the first word you had from him in which he acknowledges
or made plain that he had received the telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Excuse me, has 294 been submitted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think it has not. May I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit
294 the document that has been so identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Accepted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked Commission Exhibit No. 294 was received
in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It being understood with Mr. McKenzie that we may introduce
in evidence the photostatic copy in lieu of the original, the original having been
produced before the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak, did you have any conversation with your brother
upon his return from Russia respecting your dispatch of the telegram and his
reaction to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. I had more or less forgotten it myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a reference in your brother's letter of November 8 to
his reluctance to engage in a telephone conversation. Had you attempted to
reach him by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had decided to try to reach him by telephone on Sunday, November
1, 1959. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were unable to, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. I placed the call and I received the New
York operator, overseas operator, and there was some discussion as to what time
it was in Moscow, and so forth, and I changed my mind and did not. However,
I am aware that my mother tried and did for a moment have Lee on the telephone
in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At approximately that same date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever make any effort to reach him by telephone thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he reach you by telephone or attempt to do so as far as you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge did he.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a reference in the letter of November 8 to his willingness
to accept money from you if you would send any. Did you send him any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. My reply to that was if he used it to
come back I would gladly send it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your reply&mdash;did you write him a letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a copy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not have a copy of any letter that I wrote to
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do not know the whereabouts of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not, other than to say that I asked Mrs.
Marina Oswald if Lee kept any of my letters and her reply was that "No,
he always threw them away."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In view of that, Mr. Oswald, would you please recite to the
best of your recollection the contents of your letter in response to your brother's
letter of November 8, 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I do not remember anything other than that statement
referring to the money request. I do not recall anything else in the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have heard Mr. McKenzie read that letter through. Did
it refresh your recollection, or does it as to whether you made any comment
upon his political statements in his letter to you of November 8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not believe I did at any time make any statement in
reference to his political statements that he made in the letter of November 8.
Generally, my statements to the members of the press at the time was
that I felt Lee was not aware of what he was doing. I believe I referred
to him as a kid. And that he just generally didn't know what he
was doing, and that was just about the general text of anything I had to
say to the members of the press at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is an entry in your brother's diary of November 1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
1959, somewhat cryptic, referring to three telephone calls from mother and
brother. Now you say you didn't call. Do you know whether your brother
John ever called him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not to my knowledge. However, that was November 1,
sir, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is when the entry was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that he did not at that time try to contact
Lee by telephone, because I do not believe at that early date&mdash;he was in Japan
and was not aware that Lee had gone to Russia, because we were just
aware of it on October 31, and recalling a letter from John over there, that
he was not aware of it for a number of days after he actually went over
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. But efforts were made on the part of your mother
to reach him or she did reach him by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I understand he spoke to her briefly, and then he
hung up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of refreshing your recollection, would you
be good enough to read your brother's letter to you or what purports to
be your brother's letter to you of November 26, 1959, and in reading
through it&mdash;the reason I have asked you to look at it is that the letter is
framed as a response to what apparently were questions that you put to
him in your letter which was in response to his letter of November 8, and
seeking to refresh your recollection as to the contents of your letter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is a fairly long letter, and if Chief Justice Warren has
a little time perhaps we might have Mr. Oswald read the letter over this
evening since we are quite late in the day and I can pursue it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think we had better adjourn fairly soon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This would be a convenient time if it is convenient with
you gentlemen.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. What does Mr. McKenzie think, I see him smiling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I am not going to place myself in a position, Mr. Chief
Justice, of overruling either you or Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I can question the witness with respect to some unrelated
matters. That matter is not related to this, if I might.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, one thing I would appreciate if you could bring
out in response to some of Mr. Bogg's questions which I don't believe he
was quite clear on, I would like for the sake of the record to show what
Robert's career in the Marine Corps was from the standpoint of whether he
was a noncommissioned officer, and so forth, and so on, if you could bring
that out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I had asked him to state his military career and maybe out of modesty he
just left left that out.</p>

<p>Would you&mdash;you did give us in detail in your various stages and your
specialty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I might say going through boot camp at San Diego, Calif.,
during the second week of boot training I was selected as the right guide of
the platoon which actually was a go-between the drill instructors and the
rest of the platoon, and I retained that position all the way through the
remainder of the boot camp. On completion of boot camp I was a Pfc. I
retained that&mdash;excuse me, I retained that rank until I went to Miami, Fla.,
at which time on my departure from Miami, Fla., I received my corporal's
stripe, and prior to leaving Korea in April of 1955 I received my sergeant's
stripe which was my last stripe that I received in the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>I did receive, of course, an honorable discharge, a Good Conduct Medal, and
the various citations of the unit in Korea, Presidential Unit Citations, and
such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>I can't recall whether it was Representative Boggs or Representative Ford
who was questioning you about conversations between yourself and your
mother regarding her claim that your brother may have been a representative
of the CIA or some other government agency, and you mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
there were two occasions. I did ask you to state the detail of one of the
occasions which was in the Six Flags Motel in Dallas.</p>

<p>Would you please state where the second conversation took place and who was
present and what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The second conversation took place over the telephone in a call
that originated from my mother's house in Fort Worth, Tex., to my home in
Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>I do not know if my wife was present at my end or who was present on the
other end, at my mother's home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recognized her voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She was still pursuing this question or this speculation as far
as I am concerned that Lee was an agent of the CIA, and that she was going to
be able to, I believe use used the word "concrete", to be able to concretely establish
that with the officials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You fixed that as having occurred subsequent to the occasion in
the Six Flags Motel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you fix the time of the second occasion more definitely than
that it followed the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say this was approximately during the week of December
9, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it before or after her trip to Washington which you have
testified about when Mr. Ford questioned you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was before her trip to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when your mother returned from Washington, when she
made her trip here about which you testified in response to questions from
Representative Ford, did she say anything about her claim or speculation, as
you put it, that your brother was or might have been an agent of the CIA or
some other agency of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have not talked to my mother since she has been to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. So there has been no claim by her to you since the occasion
of the second conversation which was a telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the time of your youth and your association with your
brother Lee you testified this morning of the normal interest of boys in firearms.
You have also testified that your brother Lee was right handed. Did you ever
see him handle even a toy pistol or a cap gun other than with his right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not that I can remember. You, of course, recall sometimes
when maybe he was Two-Gun Pete, so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was Two-Gun Pete, so to speak, when we were playing cops
and robbers or cowboys and Indians, where he would have two guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the exception of having two guns when he had one he had
it in his right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What ever type of playing, shooting, sitting, or otherwise, he
always had the pistol, rifle or cap gun in his right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said you were using B-B guns. Were there occasions when
Lee also occasionally shot a B-B gun rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have a recollection that when he was mustered out of the service
in September of 1959 he spent two or three days at home in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was an occasion when you and he and some friends
of yours went on a hunting trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My brother-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or you went squirrel shooting or rabbit shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just the two of you, or did anybody accompany you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Three of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those I take it were .22's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All three were .22 caliber, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you obtain them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two of them belonged to me and one of them belonged to my
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. S.&nbsp;R. Mercer, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the occasion of this trip? How did it come about?
Did you suggest it, your brother-in-law, Lee or how?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The day that I recall that Lee stayed with us in&mdash;between the
time he was discharged and the time he was supposed to be leaving for New
Orleans was a period of 2 to 3 days. One of those days, I feel sure was a
Saturday, either we spent all day out at my in-laws' farm or the afternoon at
the farm at which time Lee and I, and my brother-in-law went hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this a couple of days before he left for Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was a couple of days before he left for New Orleans or
about 1 day or 2 days before he left for New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And then he shipped out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To locate a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that occasion, that incident, did he have occasion to discharge
the .22 caliber rifle he was carrying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see him do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From what shoulder did he, against which shoulder did he place
the butt of the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The right shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And with which hand or fingers of which hand did he pull the
trigger and discharge the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The right hand, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he exhibit any proficiency in the use of that .22 caliber gun
on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say an average amount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hunting rabbits or squirrels with a rifle takes pretty good marksmanship.
Did any of you boys bring down a rabbit or squirrel, on the fly, I
mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As I recall, one small, very small cottontail as he ran across
the peanut field, all three of us were shooting at him, and my weapon that I
had, one of the weapons that belonged to me, was a semiautomatic 22 and I
perhaps had a burst of four or five rounds that I said I got him. But all three
of us were shooting at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Did all three of you claim him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that your only victory on that hunting trip or did someone
else shoot down a squirrel or a rabbit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No squirrels were killed that day and perhaps I believe this was
the occasion that we went into what we called a briar patch located off to the
left of the farmhouse; at that particular time it was very thick with cottontails,
and I believe we exterminated about eight of them at that time between the
three of us because it was the type of brush and thorns that didn't grow very
high but we were able to see over them, so getting three of us out there it
wasn't very hard to kill eight of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, had you and your brother engaged in this very light form
of hunting at any other time during your lifetime?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you indicate the frequency of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I recall, only one other occasion that we had been hunting
together. This was during a leave that Lee had from the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During a leave that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And at which time, if I may correct myself there,
another time comes to mind, I recall two times that we had this type of
light hunting out there at that farm, at the same place. One time was during
a leave that he had from the Marine Corps. I don't recall of any game
at that particular time that we shot. I know we did handle the rifle and
fired maybe target practice, something along that line. I don't recall of
anything.</p>

<p>The second time that I now remember is during his stay after he returned
from Russia, during his stay at my home in Fort Worth, that my wife and I
and our children took him and his wife and child out to the farm to meet our
in-laws, my in-laws, and also to do a little hunting while we was out there,
and which we did just a very little bit. I believe this was on a Sunday
afternoon and we didn't stay out very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What weapons did you use on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On that occasion, I believe the same weapons we used before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that be true of all three occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe on the first occasion, which was the occasion that Lee
came home on leave, that at that time I only owned one .22 rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that the semiautomatic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not the semiautomatic, it was a bolt action
rifle, with a clip on it. However, I believe Lee either used my brother-in-law's
<span class="locked">rifle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that a bolt-action rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is a bolt-action rifle. He either used that rifle
or a single-shot, bolt-action rifle, another .22 that was out at the farm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the occasion during which you went hunting during that
3-day period, interregnum his return and his discharge and his departure for
New Orleans, was the weapon he employed a bolt-action weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it a fair statement on my part that on all the occasions that
you recall hunting with Lee he employed a bolt-action rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During your youth and prior to these occasions about which
you testified, do you know of the fact or know by rumor or otherwise that
your brother engaged in this light hunting or other kind of hunting where
he used a firearm even though he was not with you or you did not accompany
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel surely that he did, without recalling any particular time
that he told me, but his interest along that line was generally like mine, that
is hunting and fishing, and I am sure when he had an opportunity to hunt
that he did do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he ever tell you about hunting in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate that, please, tell us when the conversation
took place and the circumstances, if it was a conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The circumstances was it was in a letter I received from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that one of the letters you produced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any conversation with him in addition to the
letter, apart from the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I did along that line because as I stated our interests
in hunting and fishing was mutual and he did state that he was able <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In response to Mr. Dulles' question, would you give the conversation?
We will take care of the letter in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am trying to give the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That we talked about hunting over there, and he said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
he had only been hunting a half dozen times, and so forth, and that he had
only used a shotgun, and a couple of times he did shoot a duck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was all shotgun shooting, no rifle shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No rifle shooting, no sir. That is all they were allowed to
have, the shotgun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This conversation took place, as I understand it, on his return
from Russia when he was living with you for that month, that would be June-July
of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the extent of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you now recall it&mdash;there have been some reports, and they
are only reports as far as we of the staff are concerned, of speculation about
a television set, whether your brother purchased or owned a television set and
whether he purchased it outright or on time with a guarantee from you.</p>

<p>What information or knowledge do you have in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not aware that he purchased a television set, sir. I did
at his request, when he and Marina and the baby were living in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mercedes Street in Fort Worth, in a small duplex which <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you fix even more definitely the time of this event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was approximately the latter part of September, 1962.
And at his <span class="locked">request&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He came to you, excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He called me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He called you by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he called me at my office from his place of employment
in Fort Worth at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give us the substance of what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We talked briefly about how each family was doing, and so
forth, and he said that he would like to establish credit and he had tried
to charge something at Montgomery Ward's at Fort Worth, the West 7th Street
store, and they had stated that he needed to have somebody cosign or vouch for
him, and this was his request to me, and I said gladly I would do so, and late
that afternoon after work, this was approximately 5:30 by the time I arrived
at Montgomery Ward, I did sign for Lee's charge account. However, I was not
aware of what he was charging.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no discussion, I take it, at that time of what&mdash;the
use to which he intended to put his credit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I believe perhaps he did mention something about a baby
chair and a baby bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there ever any discussion between you about his purchase
or acquisition of a television set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you ever in his home or apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see a television set there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, you are referring to the apartment on Mercedes
Street, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I was in his home quite a few times and there was not a
television set that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On any occasion that you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On any occasion when you were in any place of residence of
your brother after his return to the United States, did you see in those premises
a television set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At my house and at my mother's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I should have been more specific and identified a residence as
one of his own rather than living with you or living with your mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At no residence that he lived in that I was aware of at any
time did I see him with a television set that I would take to be his own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussions&mdash;did any discussion ever
occur between the two of you with respect to his acquisition of a television
set?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is, as far as you are concerned, a total blank, this television
set matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think we had better adjourn pretty soon. This man has had
quite an ordeal for the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is acceptable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is it acceptable to you?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have no objection to continuing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If you would prefer to reconvene tomorrow morning we can
reconvene then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I think 9 o'clock is better. I think we can finish up in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you. At 9 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT EDWARD LEE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 9 a.m. on February 21, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present were Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman; and Allen W. Dulles,
member.</p>

<p>Also present were J. Lee Rankin, general counsel; Albert E. Jenner, Jr.,
assistant counsel; Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel; and William McKenzie,
attorney for Robert Edward Lee Oswald.</p>

<p class="p2">The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, the Commission will be in order.</p>

<p>As yesterday, I will only be able to be here for a comparatively short time,
because we have our weekly conference of the Supreme Court today. And when
I leave, Mr. Allen Dulles will conduct the hearing. We will now proceed with
the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</p>

<p>I would like to return, Mr. Oswald, to the time that your brother Lee was
discharged from military service and spent approximately 3 days at home.
You recall that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please describe his physical appearance the
last time you saw him during that 3-day period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. His hair was brown and curly, a full set of hair. His physical
appearance&mdash;he was trim, weighed approximately 140 pounds, he was approximately
5 foot 9½, he seemed to be in fine physical shape at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mentioned 3 days. Was I wrong about the 3 days, or was it a
little longer period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; my recollection on that period was 2 or 3 days, and
only during one of these day do I remember seeing him. He spent the day at
our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was your impression, sir, that he was in good health, bright
and alert mentally at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he most certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you describe his physical appearance as far as his head of
hair was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A full head of hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he appear strained in any respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His mental condition, as far as you can tell, is what you would
regard or had regarded as normal during your acquaintance with him as his
brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, will you then jump to the first time you saw him subsequently
thereto, which I understand was in June 1962. State the date, please,
as closely as you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was June 14, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Dallas, Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, on that occasion&mdash;and take in also the period of time that
he lived with you in your home during June and part of July 1962&mdash;what did
you observe, and if in contrast by way of contrast, in his physical appearance
and demeanor as against the last time you had seen him, in 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. His appearance had changed to the extent that he had lost a considerable
amount of hair; his hair had become very kinky in comparison with his
naturally curly hair prior to his departure to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had his hair been in any respect kinky, as you put it, in
November of 1959 immediately prior to his leaving for Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would have been in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. September&mdash;I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not. It was curly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that arrest your attention, the difference in the texture
of his head of hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it certainly did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You, though 5 years old at the time of your father's death&mdash;do
you recall his physical appearance insofar as his head of hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My father's head of hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had a full set of hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any baldness or tendency towards baldness in
your family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I am aware of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I include both your mother and father and relatives on
either side, to the extent that you have met those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; no one that I recall that I met, relatives on either
my father's or mother's side, had any tendency towards baldness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have none?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your brother John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He still has a full head of hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What else did you observe by way of his facial appearance&mdash;whether
he was drawn, or bouncy and healthy, as he had been when you had
seen him in September of 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He appeared the first couple of days upon his return, June 14,
1962, to be rather tense and anxious. I also noted that his complexion
had changed somewhat to the extent that he had always been very fair complected&mdash;his
complexion was rather ruddy at this time&mdash;you might say it
appeared like an artificial suntan that you get out of a bottle, but very slight&mdash;in
other words, a tint of brown to a tint of yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What else did you notice by contrast, so far as his physical
appearance is concerned? And then, next, I want to go to his demeanor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe his weight perhaps was a little bit less at that time.
I would say probably 5 pounds&mdash;approximately 5 pounds less than what he was
in 1959, before he went to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say he appeared drawn as compared with his appearance
in 1959&mdash;facially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say to some extent; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please relate to the Commission any other
differences, if there were any, in demeanor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To me, he acted the same as he did in 1959 prior to going to
Russia. Our conversations at the time he returned from Russia in June of
1962&mdash;he appeared to be the same boy I had known before, with the exception
of what I noted on his physical appearance.</p>

<p>As far as his conversations were concerned at this particular time, June of
1962, I noticed no difference.</p>

<p>He appeared to have picked up something of an accent. But I took this to
mean that because he had been speaking the Russian language and living
in Russia during a period of approximately two and a half years, that this
was the reason for the accent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did these differences in physical appearance, especially his
hair, his skin tone, his overall facial and physical appearance, lead you at
that moment, in the light of what had occurred in the meantime, your exchange
of correspondence, lead you to form an opinion, at least tentative,
as to what might have occurred or happened to your brother while he was
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In reference to that, sir; his hair&mdash;I did, either on the first
or second night, when he was there at the house&mdash;I pointed it out to him
and actually had him bend his head down to where I could look at the top
of it, and it was very thin on the top&mdash;you could see just right down to his
scalp.</p>

<p>And his comment on that was that he thought the weather had affected
his hair, the cold weather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make any comments when you met him at Love Field,
and did you ride in with him from Love Field to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. We were in my personal car, and my wife and my
children were with me. We met him and his wife and his baby. He seemed,
perhaps the word is disappointed, when there were no newspaper reporters
around. He did comment on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe his comment was something, "What, no photographers
or anything?"</p>

<p>I said, "No, I have been able to keep it quiet."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was that remark made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Love Field, as they came through the gate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make any remarks on that subject as you drove into
town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make any other comments that arrested your attention
when he arrived at Love Field or while you were driving into town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did. In reference to newspaper reporters again, or
photographers, he asked me if I had been receiving calls and so forth, and I
told him I had received two or three calls, but I said nothing, and they were
not aware of his schedule of arrival in the United States, and they were not
aware at that time, to my knowledge, that he had arrived at Love Field, and
that he was going to be at my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having in mind the changes in physical appearance, and also
the course of events since the day of his arrival at Love Field to the present
time, have you formed an opinion, Mr. Oswald, as to whether your brother
may have undergone some treatment of some kind in Russia that affected
his mind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Since Lee's death on November 24th, I have formed
an opinion in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That, perhaps in sheer speculation on my part&mdash;that due to
the nature of the change in his hair, in the baldness that appeared, I reached
the opinion that perhaps something in the nature of shock treatments or something
along that line had been given him in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You base this opinion on any factors other than or in addition to
this change of physical appearance that you noted on his return from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has the course of events affected the opinion you have now
expressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; since the course of events, since Friday, November 22,
1963, his death following on the 24th of November 1963, I have searched my own
mind for possible reasons of why or how this all came about. That has been
one of my opinions&mdash;in reference to his hair structure and so forth, and his
baldness&mdash;pardon me just a minute, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you concluded your answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has this course of events and your brother's physical appearance
and any other factors you had in mind led you to form an opinion as to whether
he was or had been an agent of the government of the USSR?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You are asking him, Mr. Jenner, to speculate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have that again, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. His question was&mdash;this is off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, may I ask a question at this time?</p>

<p>Robert, at any time after your brother returned from Russia, or at any time
after he went to Russia, did he ever remark to you as to whether or not he had
been ill while in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Has his wife, Marina Oswald, ever said anything to you about
whether or not he was ill while he resided in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And what did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you fix the time, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My conversation with Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 4 weeks ago, in one of our conversations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe in my car on the way to the cemetery, or returning from
the cemetery, to Mr. Martin's house, in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anyone other than Marina and yourself present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. State the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may fix the date more accurately here, sir; if I could possibly
refer to my diary.</p>

<p>I recall this conversation on January 13, 1964, between Marina Oswald and
myself in my car, at which time she stated to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir, to what are you now referring to refresh your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be to a followup of the conversation we had in reference
<span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me&mdash;the document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am referring to my notebook that I have been keeping in
various events that have occurred since November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record, would you read the first three
words and the last three words of the page to which you are making reference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Sunday, January 13, 1964. Jim advised <span class="locked">that"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is on the first line?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. The last line is "told her this story."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Proceed, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We had a <span class="locked">discussion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Pardon me just a second.</p>

<p>For the sake of the record, let me state this. A copy of this diary has been
furnished to the Commission, photostated by the Commission, and Mr. Jenner has
it in front of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will qualify it, Mr. Chief Justice. But I didn't want to take
Your Honor's time at the moment, because I do want to cover another subject
while you are still here.</p>

<p>Proceed, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What prompted my question as to whether or not Lee was ill
while he was in Russia was the followup of a conversation that we had in relation
to an incident that occurred some time in the year of 1963. I am not
able to place the date of that purported incident. I was advised at that time in
reference to this incident that on one day, that Lee was going to shoot at or
shoot Mr. Richard M. Nixon, that Marina N. Oswald locked Lee Harvey Oswald
in the bathroom for the entire day.</p>

<p>At the end of this brief remark in relation to Mr. Nixon, I asked her at that
time had Lee been ill or been in the hospital while he was in Russia. And, at
this time, she told me yes, that he had, on two occasions, been in the hospital
in Russia.</p>

<p>I asked her what was the nature of the illness. My best recollection of that,
sir, was that he was having difficulty with his sinus, and that the cold was bothering
him somewhat. And I do not recall anything more specific than that in
relation to the illness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question there?</p>

<p>Did Marina say whether this was while they were in Minsk, or she didn't indicate
where he was at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now stated and exhausted your recollection of everything
she said on that subject of his illness on that particular occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did not pursue the matter any further than you have
indicated with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I believe I attempted to, and with her limited knowledge of
the English language, we were encountering some difficulties. And I told her
perhaps at a later date, or something of that nature, that we could discuss it
more fully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever pursue it with her on any subsequent occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I will return to that illness feature
at a later point.</p>

<p>You have an entry in your diary under the date of January 13, <span class="locked">1964&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, in reference to Mr. Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Now, you have alluded to Mr. Nixon in testifying with respect to your conversation
on the subject of illness with Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, I will read the entry on that particular date, and
will wish to question the witness about it.</p>

<p>"Sunday, January 13, 1964. Jim advised that Marina told him that Lee
wanted to"&mdash;and there are a series of five dashes, followed by the letters, "NMR,
also, but Marina locked Lee in the bathroom all day. This was confirmed later
this day by Marina. On the way to the cemetery."</p>

<p>Is that in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please supply, if suppliable, what is indicated by the
three dashes preceding the letters "NMR" and identify what the letters "NMR"
refer to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir, correct you there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
There are five dashes there. And the word "shoot" was my intention to leave
blank there. And the initials "NMR" stands for Richard M. Nixon in reverse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, that the five dashes were inserted there as a
substitute for the word "shoot"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the initials are those of Richard M. Nixon reversed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please state fully when this matter or this
incident first came to your attention where and through and by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first time I was aware of this incident was at Mr. Jim
H. Martin's home in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Sunday, January 13, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the occasion for your being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To visit with Marina, and to take her to the cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You entered the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your wife, Mrs. Oswald, with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You entered the home, and who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. and Mrs. James H. Martin, I believe their children were
also present, and in the living room of their home there was two Secret Service
agents, or one Secret Service agent, and two Dallas police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you able to identify any of those four men?</p>

<p>Do you recall any of them at the moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, that one of the Secret Service agents, if he was
either the only one there, or two of them were there, the one that I do recall,
Mr. Bob Jameson or Jimson, of the Dallas office&mdash;the U.S. Secret Service office
in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, to what Richard M. Nixon did the initials "NMR" as you
have placed them in this note refer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the past Vice President of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, proceed to tell us about how the circumstance arose, your
first conversation of it, your first notice of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was talking with Mr. Jim Martin about various other matters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir. Where were you in talking to Mr. Jim Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was in the den of his home, sitting on a sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Jim Martin and I were sitting on the sofa, and I believe my
wife and his wife were at the end of the den in the kitchen part of it, standing
by the sink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the distance between yourselves sitting on the sofa and
the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say approximately 12 or 15 feet, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was there a doorway, was it open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it is an open room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you were all in the same room&mdash;one section of it you describe
as a den?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the other section consists of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The kitchen, the sink, refrigerator, a washing machine, built-in
oven and range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We discussed other matters. I do not recall what they were.
Just talking to him about how Marina was doing and so forth, and any other
thing that we might be talking about in general, small talk. And we finally&mdash;he
finally brought up this question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say and how did he approach it? Reproduce it as
best you can, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe he moved very close to me. I was turned towards him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
He was to my left. I might say at this time that the women at the sink would be
on my far right, behind me generally. And he related to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This incident, that Marina had told him that on a day still
not identified to me, that he, Lee Harvey Oswald, had the intention to shoot
Mr. Richard M. Nixon, and that Marina N. Oswald had locked Lee in the bathroom
for the entire day. And that was the text to my best remembrance&mdash;that
was everything that was said from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now exhausted your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of Mr. Martin's conversation to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say how he had come about this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, other than he had a conversation with Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was relating to you a conversation he had had with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say that she had reported this to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of him as to why this had not been disclosed to
you before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ask any questions of him in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>I might add that my reaction at that time was that I was rather speechless.
I believe I just shook my head in utter disbelief to what I was hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Mr. Martin relate to you when Marina had told him this
story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you question him with respect to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make any effort to fix the time when the event in
question had taken place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; in my own mind I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't question Mr. Martin about it, however?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. At this time, did you know of the rumors with regard to the
attack on General Walker or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did. And I refer, again, to the entry on January 13,
1964, and the statement that Jim advised that Marina told him that Lee wanted
to "blank NMR, also." And by that "also" I was aware of the attempt on
General Walker's life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said during the course of your conversation with
Mr. Martin in the den with respect to the information you had that an attempt
had been made by your brother on the life of General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not at this conversation, it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever talk to Mr. Martin at any time subsequent to this,
with respect to this event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;preceding this day of January 13, 1964, approximately
3 or 4 weeks prior to <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This particular event, I mean&mdash;Mr. Martin's relating to you
that Marina had advised him that your brother wanted to shoot Richard M.
Nixon, the Vice President of the United States. Did you have a further conversation
with Mr. Martin at any time subsequent to that&mdash;that is, after
January 13, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have not up to this moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not at any time later that day? You had only this one
conversation with Mr. Martin, and none other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On this subject, yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On this particular subject, you made no effort to question him
further about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have now exhausted your recollection as to all of your
conversation on this occasion with Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you at no time ever pursued it further with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you report or relate this to the Secret Service or the FBI
or any other agency of the U.S. Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Pardon me just a minute, Mr. Jenner. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>You have, have you not, furnished the FBI a copy of this diary that you have
kept since November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And likewise you furnished it to this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was your diary furnished to the Commission for the first
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. February 20, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yesterday morning when you and your counsel tendered it to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But between the 13th of January 1964 and yesterday morning,
when you tendered the diary to me, you made no tender of any written materials
nor did you relate orally to any agent or agency of the U.S. Government this
particular incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please state to whom and when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was two FBI agents on the night of&mdash;may I have a calendar,
please?</p>

<p>On February 18, 1964, I turned over my notebook to two FBI agents at my
home in Denton, Tex., at which time they asked me about this particular
incident. I referred them to my diary, and turned over the diary, with the
advice of my counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that incident related by you to them at your instance, or
did they come to you with specific reference to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They did have a specific reference to it on the night of February
18, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who raised it&mdash;you or the agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The agents did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they state to you as to how they had come to have that
information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. For the sake of the record, Mr. Jenner, I would like to state
what I told the agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, returning to&mdash;when did you tell them, Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, the best I recall it was either Monday&mdash;it was
Monday, February 17th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Monday of this week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, this past Monday.</p>

<p>And I might add that I received the diary myself sometime around 5:15 or
5 o'clock on Saturday, February 15th, and I read the diary Sunday evening,
February 16th, and gave the information to the FBI agents on February 17th,
at which time I suggested that if they would like to talk to Robert about it they
could be free to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I say something here, Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. McKenzie did not know the exact meaning of this statement on January
13, 1964. He asked me in his office on Monday afternoon, February 17,
1964, to fill in the blanks, and to give the man's name to the initials and what
it meant, at which time I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But from the 13th of January 1964 to Saturday February 15,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
1964, you had not drawn this matter to the attention of any agency of the United
States or any agent of the United States, or any other person, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that is not correct. I did not speak to any agent of
the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>My wife read my diary, and she asked me what that entry was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you prepare this diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I prepared it on the dates noted in the diary. In this particular
instance, Sunday, January 13, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That particular entry, I take it, then, from your testimony, was
made contemporaneously with the event itself&mdash;that is, on January 13, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This news from Mr. Martin startled and upset you, did it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned that you had gone to the Martin home, one of the
purposes being to take Marina to the cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As soon as you were in her presence in the automobile, or while
you were driving there, did you raise this subject with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made no mention of what Mr. Martin had said to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever speak to Marina about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she raised the question to me, or told me of the incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Was it on your way to the cemetery, while you were there, or returning from
the cemetery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the way to the cemetery, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please try to reconstruct the circumstances, and state as clearly as
you can how she raised the subject with you, and what she said&mdash;first stating,
however, who was in the automobile as you were driving to the cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was Marina N. Oswald and myself, only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, try to&mdash;give us the scene just as it occurred&mdash;how she brought it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We had been talking about the children, her children and my
children, family affairs, and so forth, attempting to carry on a reasonable facsimile
of a complete conversation within her limited knowledge of English.
And at a pause in this conversation, she started relating to me this incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, Mr. Oswald&mdash;when you say she started relating this
incident, it doesn't help us any, it is not evidentiary. How did she do it?
What did she say, as best you are able to recall? How did she bring it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. In her own words, Robert, try to reconstruct exactly what
was said to you from the time you left Jim Martin's house until you went&mdash;in
Dallas, Tex., until you arrived in Fort Worth, Tex., at the cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On this subject, to the best of my knowledge, Marina said to
me, "Robert, Lee also wanted to shoot Mr. Nixon." And, at that time, I believe
I gave her the statement that "Yes, Jim told me about this when we were
sitting in the den that afternoon."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say you gave her the statement&mdash;you mean that is what
you said to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>And she made her statement, referring to this incident of Mr. Nixon.</p>

<p>And then she <span class="locked">related&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I might say this, sir. In practically the same words that Mr.
Martin had told me, because he had reportedly received the conversation from
Marina, within her limited English&mdash;it rang a bell to the extent that the words
were close to being the same to the way Mr. Martin had related it to me.</p>

<p>It was a very brief statement on her behalf that Lee was going to shoot Mr.
Richard M. Nixon, and that she, Marina N. Oswald, locked Lee in the bathroom
all day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
I did ask her was he very angry. Her reply was at first he certainly was, or
was, but <span class="locked">later&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say at first, you mean her first response to your
question was, "He certainly was."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; or that he was. I don't believe she knows the word
"certainly." That he was angry, and that he calmed down during the period
that he was locked in the bathroom.</p>

<p>And I asked her at the end of that statement, "Did he beat you or hurt
you?"</p>

<p>She said, "No, he did not spank me."</p>

<p>That is, to the best of my recollection, the entire conversation on the incident
of Mr. Richard M. Nixon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire&mdash;you have now exhausted your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of her as to when this incident took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she volunteer it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of Mr. Martin as to when the incident took
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall that I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make any inquiry as to where they were residing at
the time the incident was alleged to have taken place, or might have taken
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you assume any particular residence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I assumed that this took place in one of two apartments that
they lived in in Dallas, Tex. The addresses I am not familiar with. They are
the only two houses or apartments that I did see for myself from the outside
on the night of Thanksgiving, 1963, whatever the date was, at which time we
had dinner at the Martin's home for the first time that Mrs. Martin had met
Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>And, at the conclusion of the dinner, the Secret Service agents, with us,
wanted Marina to point out to them the two apartments that they had lived
in in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you accompanied them, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I was in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you thereafter pursue this occurrence, or alleged occurrence,
and obtain any additional information about it, with anybody&mdash;the Secret
Service, the FBI, Mr. Thorne, Mr. Martin, Marina&mdash;anybody at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of Marina as to how she locked him in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it occur to you that it might be quite difficult for a 98-pound
woman to lock your brother in a bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it has occurred to me exactly how this was possible,
to the extent that a bathroom usually has a lock on the inside and not on the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, if he didn't want to be locked in the bathroom, she would
have quite a difficulty&mdash;she could not force him into the bathroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, that is a question for rank speculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate that, sir. I am trying to jog his recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. May I ask him a question at this time to maybe perhaps assist you?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. You may ask, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Robert, has Marina told you at anytime or do you now
know where they were residing when this occurrence happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she has not. And I am not aware from any source
where this event took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Were you ever in their apartments in Dallas, Tex., at anytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Prior to going to&mdash;with the Secret Service and Marina on
Thanksgiving evening, was that the first time that you had ever seen the apartments
where they lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. I think we will take a break now.</p>

<p>I must be going to my conference. So we will recess for just a moment.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenner, if you will proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Oswald, we have some data that indicates or confirms the fact that Mr.
Nixon was invited to Dallas in April of 1963, by the Southeast Dallas Chamber
of Commerce to receive the Good American Award, but that at the last minute
it was necessary for him to cancel his attendance&mdash;he was unable to attend, and
did not come to Dallas on that occasion. There was some publicity in connection
with the giving of the award prior to the event. But I take it from your testimony
that at least you did not pursue with Marina or with Mr. Martin their
fixing the time of the event in which Marina, according to the information given
you, locked your brother Lee in the bathroom to prevent him from any violence
on Mr. Nixon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may, with Mr. Dulles' approval, interrupt you
one more time for another statement.</p>

<p>I recall when Mr. Nixon was coming to Dallas at the invitation of Mr. Carlson
and others to receive this award.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Nixon did come to Dallas some time within 6 weeks prior to
November 22, 1963. The exact date I cannot fix, because I don't recall the
exact date.</p>

<p>But it is my best recollection that he was there in that period of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. McKenzie, that may well be so.</p>

<p>Our information indicates to the contrary&mdash;that he was in Dallas on the 21st
of November 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is what I say, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said several weeks prior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I said some time within 6 weeks prior to November 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, our information is that he was in Dallas on the 21st of
November 1963, and not prior to that time.</p>

<p>But we <span class="locked">will&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think there is a misunderstanding there. You are technically
correct. It was the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I couldn't remember the exact date, Mr. Dulles, and I wasn't
going to be tied down to any exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are technically correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. November 21 was before November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, the inference of the 6 <span class="locked">weeks&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, the reason I say 6 weeks&mdash;as I explained to Mr.
Dulles, I don't know exactly when it was, but I know it was prior to November
22d, Dick Nixon was in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, Mr. Chairman, we will obtain that information and make
it part of the record.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Oswald, in view of what you have related with regard to this particular
event, I ask you this question: Would you please state why you did not
report this circumstance to any agency or agent of the U.S. Government up to
the time that you gave your diary to Mr. McKenzie and he turned it over to
the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. An assumption on my part at the time this was told to me was
that some Federal agents were aware of this. Nobody told me that they were
aware of it. I repeat, again, it was an assumption on my part that somebody was
perhaps aware of this, as they were, before I was&mdash;aware of the alleged shot
at General Walker of the same year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Did you discuss this event with Mrs. Oswald, that is, your wife, Vada?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Briefly I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Some time around the latter part of January 1964, at which
<span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. That is several weeks after you made this entry
in your diary, and after the event occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two or three weeks after I made this entry in my diary January
13, yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were the circumstances that led you to discuss the matter
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My wife had read my diary, and she had come to this entry on
January 13, 1964, and she asked me to fill in the blanks and state who it was,
at which time I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did I understand you to say earlier that your wife also prepared
a diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, she did not. She had read my diary, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Until you retained Mr. McKenzie, had you retained counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I had consulted counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Weldon Knight, of Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you exhibited to Mr. Knight the diary we have been
discussing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was not aware of the diary we are discussing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your testimony you did not discuss this particular
event with Mr. Knight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever exhibit your diary to Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss the existence of the diary with Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to the time you delivered the diary to Mr. McKenzie, had
you disclosed to anybody other than Mrs. Oswald, your wife Vada, the existence
of the diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mrs. Marina Oswald, approximately the first week of February
1964, or January 1964&mdash;I advised her that <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You say approximately the first week of January or February.
You mean approximately the first week of February or the last week of January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;thank you&mdash;that I was writing down various happenings
that had occurred since November 22, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were in the process of preparing a memorandum, really,
rather than a diary, of past events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did you do any more than just tell her that you were preparing such a statement
or memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not have occasion, then, at that time to discuss further
with her the Richard M. Nixon matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since we have referred to this document, Mr. Chairman, could
I pursue it, at least as to how it came into existence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you propose to introduce it in evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>I propose now to qualify the diary which you so kindly produced yesterday,
Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, yesterday morning your counsel, Mr. McKenzie,
delivered to me as an agent of the Commission a ringed notebook, which you
have before you, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that notebook still intact as it was when you delivered
it to me yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does any part of that notebook contain any entries relating to
anything involving your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you note the particular pages and put a paper clip on
them, please?</p>

<p>Would you read the first paragraph of the first page which has been clipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Dated December 6, 1963, for the history of the past 2 weeks
as seen through my eyes, and heard with my ears, and felt with my body,
I write for future reference for myself and for the future members of the
family."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read the last sentence of the last page you have
clipped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Marina said she was shocked when the FBI told her this story."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I approach the witness, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Please.</p>

<p>What was "this story"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May we consider that a question to the witness, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may read the entire entry dated January 19, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this entry in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it made contemporaneously with the event recorded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This event took place on Sunday, January 19, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you made an entry contemporaneously or shortly thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For the purpose of writing down a reference for myself and
for my family on all events that I could learn about in relation to Lee's life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, before the paragraph is read, if I may&mdash;is there
another entry in your handwriting on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it the only other entry on that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it the entry of January&mdash;Sunday, January 13, 1964, relative
to Mr. Nixon about which you have already testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And which you have read in full into the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you are going to read for the purpose of the record the
balance of that page, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Sunday, January 19, 1964. Marina and the Martins had gone
to Kathy Ford's house in Richardson, when we arrived at the Martin's house
around 2 p.m. They returned approximately about 4:45 p.m. On the way to
the grocery, Jim said the FBI had asked Marina during the week if she
<span class="locked">knew"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a blank there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I had omitted a word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "that Lee".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it an inadvertent omission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the omission was what word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "If she knew Lee <span class="locked">had"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You now have a specific recollection you intended to write the
word "Lee"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>"If she knew Lee had tried to commit suicide while in Russia prior to their
marriage. She did not, and it was the first I knew about it. Marina later confirmed
this, and said that she had asked Lee two or three times what was the
cut on his wrist, pointing to the cut on his left wrist. Lee would become very
mad and tell her nothing. The FBI read this in Marina's book."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. "Read this in Marina's book." You misread there. "The FBI
read this in Lee's book."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>"Understand he had a date with another girl around 8 p.m. (This is in
Moscow.)"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that in parentheses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The words "this is in Moscow" are in parentheses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>"And right before she was due to arrive, he cut his wrist. Marina said she
was 'shocked' when the FBI told her this story."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will not question the witness further about that entry&mdash;unless
you wish to pursue it at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No, follow your own order.</p>

<p>There is one question I would ask that relates to the past. That is what you
testified to just a moment before. This is with regard to locking in the bathroom
for a day.</p>

<p>Did Marina indicate that that was for the purpose of keeping Lee away from
possibly Nixon, if he was to be there that day, or was it to cool him down? Did
you get any impression as to what the purpose was of the locking in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I most certainly did. Her intentions as related to me
was to keep him from shooting at Mr. Nixon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that particular day, or on some future occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say on the particular day&mdash;pardon me. I misunderstood
the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I think he misunderstood the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Was it your impression that Mr. Nixon was to be in Dallas on that particular
day, and that that is the day that Marina locked him in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she locking him in the bathroom to cool him off so he would
not attempt it when Mr. Nixon might be in town some later date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it was her intention, or my impression of her intentions,
that she locked him in the bathroom on that date, to keep him on that date from
shooting at Mr. Richard M. Nixon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So your impression was this was an imminent event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or that she thought it was an imminent event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, that, thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is all I have now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your testimony that this ringed notebook, and in
part a diary, is a record first of past events&mdash;that you prepared it subsequently
to the events recorded therein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, start from the beginning, that is the first page, the first
paragraph of which you have read, in order to identify it. I notice a date&mdash;December
6, 1963. Do you find it, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the date on which you prepared at least the first page or
started this memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please take that memorandum or notebook and
identify each page that you wrote at the first sitting&mdash;that is, what you first
recorded in the book on the first occasion you wrote in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the eighth page, approximately midway down, in the left-hand
margin I have a date of 12&ndash;7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, I take it, therefore, that your first entries were made&mdash;that you made,
covered the pages commencing with the page dated at the top December 6, 1963,
and proceeding consecutively to the eighth page, and in the center of that page
approximately, at the margin, there appears the figures 12&ndash;7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wrote all the intervening material at one sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the 12&ndash;7 refers, I take it, to December 7, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the day following your having made the first entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is December 6, 1963.</p>

<p>Are all the pages that intervene in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may, and for the purpose of the record, to
help speed up the proceedings, I will state on behalf of Mr. Oswald that all the
pages of the diary which you have there in front of you, and which should be
and will be marked an exhibit to the Commission's record, are in Mr. Oswald's
handwriting, they were written simultaneously on the date as shown in the
diary, and were his recollections of the event as it occurred on that date. Is
that correct Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate your suggestion, Mr. McKenzie, but there are some
breaks that I would like to identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Pardon me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have marked the document now as Commission Exhibit 323.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 323 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you wish to ask that it be admitted in evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If I may defer that for a moment.</p>

<p>Are all of the pages of the diary which you have separated and clipped together
at my request in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, proceeding from the eighth page, which contains the date
entry December 7, 1963, would you please identify what you wrote on the particular
occasion&mdash;that is, December 7, 1963?</p>

<p>I take it the balance of that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The balance of that page, the following entire page, and the
first part of the next page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Down to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "for me to come to his office" and a <span class="locked">date&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the date 12-11-63?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are these pages numbered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I think we should have them numbered at this time, if the
Commission would so desire, sir. We can number them&mdash;Robert can number
them at the bottom of the page consecutively all the way through, and likewise
number the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to number the photostat that we have rather than
to place any markings on the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it help you, Mr. Chairman, if I examined from the seat
beside you, so you can see the exhibit?</p>

<p>The occasion next after December 7, 1963, when you made an entry in your
notebook, I take it, was on December 11, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you please indicate commencing with that entry in
the upper portion of the page how much&mdash;what portions of the notebook you
wrote on that occasion?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the page referred to, from the date of 12-11-63, on the 11th
page following that, I have an asterisk in the left-hand column.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read the first line of that page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Complete with Marina."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the last line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "around 11 a.m., the first great shock of the <span class="locked">day"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just the last line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "also they were having a hard time locating".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there is an asterisk in the left-hand margin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Approximately the center of the page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gather from your testimony that the entry you made then on
11th of December 1963, commenced at the point that you have that date in the
margin, and runs to, throughout the pages consecutively&mdash;down to the asterisk
of the page you have now identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you make the entry that is opposite the asterisk, and
that follows the asterisk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall the exact date, sir. I do recall stopping at that
period and making the balance of the entries at a later date after December 11,
1963, and prior to January 13, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were they all made at one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The post asterisk entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. From the asterisk until the completion of the diary
to the date of January 13, 1964, was made at one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it recorded past events. It was not made contemporaneously
with the events recorded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that the first entries in this notebook that are diary entries
in the sense that they are made contemporaneously with the event, to immediately
record the event, are those appearing on the last page, consisting of two
entries, one dated Sunday, January 13, 1964, and one dated Sunday, January 19,
1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>I have noted an error in those dates to the extent that there is only 6 days
in between those two Sundays. One date is wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean either January 13, 1964, is incorrect or Sunday,
January 19, 1964, is incorrect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. It was an error on my part. And if I may refer
to a calendar, I will correct the dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a '63 calendar you have there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; this is a '64.</p>

<p>I would correct the first date as appeared in my diary of Sunday, January 13,
1964, to be corrected to January 12, 1964, and the second date of January would
be correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So wherever in your testimony this morning you have referred
to the Sunday, January 13 date, that is to be corrected to January 12, 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of further identification of the exhibit, and in
the context of Mr. McKenzie's and my agreement to substitute a photostatic
copy for the original. I will undertake to number the pages of the exhibit
on the photostatic copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Would you like Robert to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I would like to have him follow, so that the numbers on
the photostat correspond with the pages consecutively in the original.</p>

<p>As I number the pages, Mr. Oswald, would you follow me, so that the page
numbers I place on the exhibit are correct in that they are in sequence with
the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The first page I am marking No. 1. The next page, No. 2. The
next, No. 3.</p>

<p>Would you observe each time that the photostat is a photostat of the
original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am observing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Page 4 is next.</p>

<p>Five is next. Six is next. Seven is next. Eight is next. Nine is next.
Ten is next. Eleven is next. Twelve is next. Thirteen is next. Fourteen.
Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty.
Now, page 20 is the reverse side of the page numbered on its face 19, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that is not correct. It is an insertion to the page that
has not been numbered yet, page 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But isn't it a fact that the entry on the page now numbered 20
is on the reverse side of the page numbered on its face 19?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am sorry. You are correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the point you are making is that the entry on page now
numbered 20 relates to page 21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>We will now mark page 21. Twenty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What are you marking that insert as far as our copy is
concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As page 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Wouldn't it be better to make it 20-A?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought from the record that I had made clear that page
number 20 was the reverse side of page numbered on its face 19.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right. Just so you are clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have we covered page 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Twenty-seven.</p>

<p>As I proceeded in numbering the photostat, you placed, did you not, in your
own handwriting&mdash;followed me and placed the same page numbers in your own
handwriting on the pages in question as you wrote the numbers on them&mdash;the
same pages&mdash;on the photostat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, do the entries that you have made in the notebook
on pages 1 through 27 now identified represent your recollection of the events
recorded at the time that you recorded the events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had an opportunity to review those entries since they
were made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you reread any portions of any of these entries, other
than or in addition to those you read to the Commission this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Chairman, I now offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit
No. 323 the pages of the notebook which have been identified by the witness,
and which have been numbered 1 through 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Exhibit No. 323 will be accepted.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 323 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I would like to direct your attention to page 5 of your
notebook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that point you were recording the course of events on what
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Friday, November 22, 1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To orient you and the Commission, the entry to which I refer,
that is the paragraph, reads as follows. Follow me, please.</p>

<p>"Mother and I talked briefly and after about 30 minutes we were taken across
the hall to where Marina and the two children were. (This was the first I
knew of the new baby.) A Mrs. Paine was also present. We talked a little
and shortly Mr. Paine&mdash;who the police had been talking to, came out of the
office and Mrs. Paine introduced us. I did not like the appearance of Mr. Paine,
nothing really to put my finger on, but I just had a feeling.</p>

<p>"I still do not know why or how"&mdash;what is that next word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "but".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "But Mr. and Mrs. Paine are somehow involved in this affair.
Shortly thereafter Mother, Marina, and the children and the Paines left to go to
the Paines' house in Irving, and I advised them I would stay there and see them
tomorrow."</p>

<p>When you recorded "I would stay there" you mean remain in Dallas? What
did you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My full meaning there, sir, was that I would remain at the
Dallas police station, and take a hotel room in Dallas, and spend the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask just one question there for clarity? It refers to an
office. Is that the office of the Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Dallas police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from this entry you had not heretofore ever met either
Mr. or Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you elaborate upon, please, your statement recorded
on December 6, 1963, that you did not like the appearance of Mr. Paine "nothing
really to put my finger on, but I just had a feeling. I still do not know why or
how, but Mr. and Mrs. Paine are somehow involved in this affair."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, I was introduced to Mr. Paine at the Dallas police office
on the night of November 22, 1963. His wife introduced us. His handshake
was very weak and what I might term a live fish handshake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Live or dead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And his general appearance, his face, and most particularly his
eyes to me had what I would term a distant look to them, and that he wasn't
really looking at you when he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if you will, please, would you ask the witness
whether he meant a live fish or a cold dead fish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I believe I mean a live fish. A cold, dead fish would be stiff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are seeking to obtain the basis upon which you made this
entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was Mr. Paine's general appearance and the manner in which
he held himself, and by this I mean the way he stood and the way he looked at
you, and you had that feeling, as I stated before, that he was not really looking
at you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You say there that Mrs. Paine introduced Mr. Paine to you.
When had you previously made the acquaintance of Mrs. Paine&mdash;just before
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. On that same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you record that in your memorandum, do you not, on a
previous page?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The fact of the introduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think the Commission would be interested further in explaining
your remark "I still do not know why or how, but Mr. and Mrs. Paine are somehow
involved in this affair." What did you mean by that? That is on page 6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I just wanted to verify that this was still under my
date, original entry of December 6, 1963.</p>

<p>At the time I wrote the statement, "I still do not know why or how, but Mr.
and Mrs. Paine are somehow involved in this affair." I meant by this statement
that I had gathered that after our meeting of November 22, 1963, at the Dallas
police station, to the date of December 6, 1963, that Mr. Paine and Mrs. Paine
were separated, and that I had read approximately at this time&mdash;and I am not
sure that I had read this particular thing in the newspaper prior to December 6,
1963&mdash;but I feel like I did&mdash;that in a Dallas paper it referred to an incident
at a Grand Prairie Rifle Range where some people had identified Lee as being
at this rifle range, and that on one occasion a man, and the description was
given in the newspaper, had handed Lee Harvey Oswald a rifle over this fence
where he was standing inside the rifle range. As I read this description in the
newspaper, I reached the conclusion from that description that it was Mr. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any other basis that you now recall upon which you predicated
the statement that, "Somehow Mr. and Mrs. Paine are involved in this affair."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; if the newspaper I read at that particular time is
dated after December 6, 1963, the statement that I just read a few minutes ago,
"I still do not know why or how, but Mr. and Mrs. Paine are somehow involved
in this affair"&mdash;I made that statement then based on my meeting Mr. and Mrs.
Paine at the Dallas police station on Friday night, November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please describe Mr. Paine as he appeared on
that particular occasion&mdash;first, his physical appearance, and then follow with
how he was dressed. Give his height, weight, color of eyes and hair, as you
recall them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recall Mr. Paine to be approximately 6 feet in height. I do
not recall the color of his hair. He is of slender build. Perhaps I would establish
his weight around 160 or 165 pounds. His facial appearance was quite
drawn&mdash;and this is a conclusion on my part, because I had not met him before&mdash;he
appeared to be quite drawn in the face.</p>

<p>His eyes, I would say, would have to me a hollow look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What color were his eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't presently recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made no note of it at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his complexion&mdash;ruddy, pale?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say his complexion would be ruddy complected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he clean shaven?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my recollection, he was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No mustache, no beard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What else did you notice about his appearance? How did he
part his hair? Do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether he did part it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not. I believe this to be correct&mdash;that I never did
get any higher than looking at Mr. Paine's eyes, and I do not believe I looked
at his hair or above his eyes at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you with Mr. Paine on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately five minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever seen Mr. Paine subsequently thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On how many occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On one other occasion, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be approximately a Sunday afternoon in the middle
of December 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be approximately a week after you made this entry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. In the presence of Mr. Jim H. Martin, and Mr. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Thorne. We traveled from Mr. Martin's home to the Paines' house in Irving
to pick up Marina's and Lee's clothes that were still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Still at the Paines' home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Still at the Paines' home. I saw Mr. and Mrs. Paine again on
that day&mdash;I mean at that time. That was my second and only time I have ever
seen them. Mr. and Mrs. Paine helped gather up the belongings of Marina and
the children and Lee's personal belongings that were still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To make it clear, Mr. Oswald, did Mr. Paine accompany you
with Mr. Martin and Mr. Thorne to the Paine home, or did you meet Mr. Paine
when you arrived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We met Mr. Paine and Mrs. Paine on our arrival at their home
in Irving, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 45 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was he clothed on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In a sport shirt and a pair of slacks, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how was he clothed on the occasion that you record here
on page 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe also at that time, sir, that he had a sport shirt on and
a pair of slacks, and perhaps a sport jacket or jacket of some type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was his head covered on either occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No. sir, it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you notice, if anything, as to whether he had straight
hair or a full head of hair on him? Was he bald?</p>

<p>You have already said you don't recall the color of his hair, am I correct on
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>In referring to the second meeting of Mr. Paine and myself, in reference to
his hair, I would say his hair was practically a full set of hair, dark and short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say short, you mean cut short, or a crew cut?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, just cut short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you describe your own head of hair, as to its cut? Is it
cut short?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Presently, I would describe wearing mine at a medium length,
for myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. How about Mr. Jenner's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would describe his as being in medium length.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you are right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask one question there?</p>

<p>Had you known prior to November 22d that Marina was living with Mrs.
Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You had not known that before November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know at the time you were introduced to Mr. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had become advised in that respect by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are those the only two occasions you have had any contact with
Mr. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe her, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A tall woman, approximately 110 pounds&mdash;and by tall I mean
approximately 5 foot 11, or 6 feet in height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Weighing only 110 pounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, very slender. A slender face, also&mdash;not a full face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say also, are you now referring to Mr. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was referring to my statement that Mrs. Paine was
slender, and also that she was slender in the face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Long hair, I believe to be brown in color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did she do her hair, was it in braids?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I believe it was just hanging down long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say long, how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Shoulder height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, would you accommodate us&mdash;not to do it now, but
at noontime, if you have the time, to read through, your diary to the court reporter,
because some of the writing I have difficulty interpreting. The Commission
would appreciate it if you would interpret your own writing on the
exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir. I understand that you want me to read the entire
diary, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, to the court reporter&mdash;as part of the record, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of a student were you, Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe my average in school was&mdash;if I may, sir, ask you&mdash;are
you talking about my over-all average?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir, I seek only the over-all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say a C or C-plus, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with the scholarship in that respect of your
brother John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not. I could, if you wish me to, make an opinion
on what I think it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This opinion being based upon your attending school with him,
as you testified yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And discussions with him back and forth between the both of
you as to how you were getting along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Common interest in your progress scholarshipwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your present recollection as to his scholarship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would be a C-plus or a B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A touch higher than yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have an opportunity during your lifetime to form a like
opinion as to the scholarship of your brother Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was his scholarship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say a C to a C-plus, in the same category that I place
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald and Mr. McKenzie, Mr. Chairman, have furnished
us with the originals of a series of letters and postcards which Mr. Oswald, the
witness, received from his brother Lee Harvey Oswald. We have prepared
photostatic copies on a Xerox machine of each of those letters, and each envelope
relating to that letter. And in the case of postcards the front and reverse side
of postcards.</p>

<p>We were further accommodated, by&mdash;yesterday afternoon following the close
of the session&mdash;by sitting down with Mr. Oswald and in his presence comparing
the photostatic copy of each document with the original, the original being in the
possession of Mr. Oswald. And I am marking each of those documents with an
exhibit number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you give us, Mr. Jenner, the first and last dates, so we have
an idea of the period covered?</p>

<p>I have a general idea, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Two of these items are not in exact sequence, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Two have been introduced already, have they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, I think you are right, Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct. A letter of November 8, 1959, introduced in
evidence yesterday. I don't recall what the second one was, but at <span class="locked">least&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were they marked at that time as exhibits?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> That was marked as an exhibit. And Mr. Liebeler has it.</p>

<p>The November 8 letter, Mr. Chairman, is marked Commission Exhibit No.
294, and it is in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There was only one letter, or were there two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was just one letter. I think, if you please, you have
reference to a telegram, which is Exhibit No. 293.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is it&mdash;the telegram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Being a telegram dated 14 June 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And these other exhibits cover what period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They commence&mdash;the first, Commission Exhibit No. 295, is a letter
of eight pages dated November 26, 1959, and concluding with Exhibit No. 322,
a letter of two pages dated March 16, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were those all from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were all from Russia, save the letter dated March 17, 1963,
being Exhibit No. 322, a letter of two pages. All the others are from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Where was that letter from&mdash;do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is postmarked&mdash;the envelope "Lee H. Oswald, P.O. Box 2915,
Dallas, Texas."</p>

<p>And the cancellation stamp likewise says Dallas, Texas.</p>

<p>The date is that which I have already recited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was after Lee Harvey's return from the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, he returned in June of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And that letter is dated what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. March 17, 1963.</p>

<p>Would you follow me, Mr. Oswald? In each instance, when we compared the
letters and the envelopes, it is a fact, is it not, Mr. Oswald, that the letter in
question was contained in the envelope of which we have a photostatic copy&mdash;and
was received by you intact? That is, the envelope was sealed, and the letter
content was in the envelope, that you personally opened the envelope and removed
the letter content? That in each instance, the letter content is in the
handwriting of your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, entirely, with the exception
of Commission Exhibit 299, which is a letter of three pages dated May 31, 1961,
upon the last page of which there is a paragraph in the handwriting of Marina
Oswald, written in the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I take that to be Mrs. Marina Oswald's writing at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there appears on that page following that paragraph written
in Russian what purports to be an English interpretation of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Furthermore, that in each instance the envelope and the letter
content is&mdash;are in the same condition now as they were when you received them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Except for opening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Except for the opening of the envelope which was necessary for
you to do in order to remove the content. Is my statement correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With this exception, sir. That a number of the letters were not
opened by me personally. By that, I mean my wife opened them when she
received the mail at the house.</p>

<p>I have marked the chronological date on the front of them in the last few days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that there appears on these exhibits in your handwriting a
date on the envelope and in some instances on the letter content?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you wrote thereon, and which was not on either the
envelope or the letter at the time it was received by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those exhibit numbers&mdash;excuse me. There are three postcards&mdash;Commission
Exhibit No. 310, dated December 11, 1961, which is a Christmas
card, Commission Exhibit 319, which is a postcard dated October 10, 1962, and
Commission Exhibit 321, a postcard dated April 10, 1962. Each of those was
received by you in due course, Mr. Oswald, as you related to me yesterday.</p>

<p>I want you to confirm this. And is in the handwriting of your brother, Lee
Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>And except for notations of dates which appear thereon or may appear thereon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
in your handwriting, they are in the same condition now as when you received
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I wish you would&mdash;I want to exhibit to you the postcard
dated April 10, 1962, which is Commission Exhibit No. 321.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As I understand it, these letters have not yet been formally
introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They have not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Very well.</p>

<p>I might add, Mr. McKenzie, that, of course, one does not know whether those
letters were opened by the authorities in the Soviet Union before being forwarded.
I think that ought to be on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 321 I now hand you, Mr. Oswald. There
is a date appearing thereon which reads, according to my interpretation 10&mdash;and
then I cannot quite decipher it.</p>

<p>Would you look at the original, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The European system of marking is different from the American
system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I seek to bring out, sir.</p>

<p>Do you now have the original before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read the figures to which I point? The first is 10?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 10/4/62.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Indicating what date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. April 10, 1962, in accordance with the European system of
dating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of putting the day first, the month second, and the year last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall whether these letters were opened by cutting or
opened by unsealing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe without exception, sir, looking at the originals, that
they were opened by unsealing, rather than cutting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I was asking because it is sometimes possible, by modern methods,
to determine whether a letter has been opened and resealed, and if the letter is
cut, that can be done.</p>

<p>If the letter has been torn open where the seal is, you cannot do anything with
it. You cannot always do this, but there are certain techniques.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chairman, did you have reference to when Robert opened
the letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, what I had reference to is to whether if the letters were
cut and not resealed, then there is a certain possibility of ascertaining whether
the letter has been previously opened by a censor, and then resealed. I was
just getting at that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Dulles is interested, I see, in whether the letters had been
censored in Russia before they arrived in the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was my point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I inquire of the witness on that subject further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Let me state this for the record. When Robert Oswald or
his wife opened the letters, as you can plainly see from the letters here in front
of you, they were either opened by letter opener&mdash;a knife or a letter opener, or
just torn open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, it is entirely possible and might even be probable
that the Commission would be interested in examining the originals on this
subject&mdash;that is, to determine through experts as to whether the envelopes had
been opened and censored, and the contents censored, before being resealed, if
they had been so opened, and dispatched to the United States. And I take it
that your inquiry was directed towards that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I inquire of Mr. McKenzie, in the light of that fact, as to
whether these originals of these letters would be available to us so that we may
have expert examination of them for that purpose?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie.</span> Yes, sir; I will make them available at any time that the Commission
so desires.</p>

<p>And I would like further to say, Mr. Chairman, that it is my opinion, based
on a reading of these letters&mdash;and I feel that Robert Oswald concurs in my
opinion here&mdash;that many of the letters were censored, because the letters actually
have reference to the censor in many instances. And I speak of that&mdash;the censor
in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. I have not yet read the letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The photostats that we have of the letters will reveal that to
which Mr. McKenzie is now referring. We took the face of each envelope and
in most instances of the reverse side of the envelope. And in each instance the
front and reverse side of each postcard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And in each case I believe we will have in our records, will we
not, the date when it was mailed and the date of receipt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the extent that is revealed by the face and reverse side of
the envelope; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Because if you have a case where a letter takes four or five days,
longer than another letter, that may mean nothing, or it may mean quite a good
deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. In some instances, Mr. Chairman, it took five days to receive a
letter from the Soviet Union to Fort Worth, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is par for the course, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>But I might also add sometimes it takes five days for a letter to get from downtown
Dallas to the suburbs in Dallas, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, <span class="locked">Mr.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, sir, if I may, I would like to say something to my
attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Proceed, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to the letter of September 10, 1961, please?
That is Commission Exhibit 305.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition&mdash;did anything accompany that letter in the way of
photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is a reference made to those photographs in the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you still have the photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have them there before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how many are there, and what do they depict?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There is a total of three photographs depicting purportedly
pictures in Minsk, Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there any handwriting on the reverse side of any of these
exhibits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; on two of the three photographs there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will mark this Exhibit as Commission Exhibit 304, the next as
304-A and the next as 304-B.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits 304 and 304-A
and 304-B for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness now has before him a photograph marked Commission
Exhibit 304, on the reverse side of which appears some handwriting.</p>

<p>Do you recognize that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> I recognize it to be Lee Harvey Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Trade Union Hall on the Main Street."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on the opposite side on which this handwriting appears is
a picture of a public building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I turn your attention to the document marked Commission
Exhibit No. 304-A. On the reverse side of that does there appear some handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose handwriting is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recognize that to be Lee Harvey Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "A square in Minsk."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on the opposite side is also depicted a public building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit No. 304-B, does the reverse side of that exhibit contain
any handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The face of the exhibit, however, depicts a plaza with some
public buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you replace those photographs, please, in the envelope
with the original?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you turn to the letter dated January 30, 1962, being
Commission Exhibit No. 314?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there any contents accompanying this letter in addition
to the letter itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe it did contain, sir&mdash;since there is no reference within
the letter <span class="locked">itself&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is my recollection that it did contain two photographs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it not a fact, sir, that when you exhibited the original of the
letter, the original of the envelope, and removed the contents yesterday afternoon
in my presence, that the two photographs to which you now refer were
contained in the envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Liebeler, would you give us those A and B numbers,
please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 314-A and B.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits 314-A and
314-B, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directing your attention to Commission Exhibit 314-A, that is a
photograph, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there handwriting on the reverse side of that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What does it say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "April 30, 1961. Marina&mdash;Lee."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, turn to the face of the exhibit, do you recognize the persons
depicted in that photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Left to right, Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the exhibit in the same condition it was when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
removed the exhibit from the envelope upon receipt of the envelope, except for
the exhibit number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to the other exhibit, Commission Exhibit No.
314-B?</p>

<p>And does the reverse side of that exhibit contain some handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What does it say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Marina, wedding day, April 30, 1961."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to the face of the exhibit. Do you recognize the
person depicted on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that exhibit in the same condition now as it was when you
received it and removed it from the envelope in which it was contained, being
the letter dated January 30, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence the series of letters which I
have identified, and which the witness has confirmed, and the contents, being
the now five photographs which have been identified, as Commission Exhibits
Nos. 295, being a letter of eight pages, dated November 26, 1959; 296, a letter of
one page&mdash;we don't have a more accurate date than the summer of 1959; 297, a
letter of one page, dated December 17, 1959; 298, a letter of two pages, May 5,
1961; 299, a letter of three pages, dated May 31, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Pardon me, Mr. Jenner, just a second.</p>

<p>The letter that you have referred to as being dated December 17, 1959, does not
have a date on it. It's received December 17, 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is in the witness' handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes; in the witness' handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The letter itself is undated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The words "received" and the figures December 17, 1959, are
written by you on the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that in fact the date it was received here in America by
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you for following me, Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, Exhibit 299 is the letter which contains in part
the paragraph written in Russian which on its face purports to have been a notation
by Marina, which we have already identified.</p>

<p>Exhibit 300 is a letter of two pages, dated June 26, 1961.</p>

<p>Exhibit 301 is a letter of two pages dated July 14, 1961.</p>

<p>Exhibit 302 is a letter of one page dated July 28, 1961.</p>

<p>Exhibit 303 is a letter of two pages dated August 21, 1961.</p>

<p>Exhibit 305 we have already identified. That is September 10, 1961, the letter
of three pages which contain the pictures of the public buildings and plaza in
Minsk, Russia.</p>

<p>Exhibit 306 is a letter of two pages dated October 22, 1961.</p>

<p>Exhibit 307 is a letter of three pages dated November 20, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Pardon me just a second, Mr. Jenner. Don't you have one
dated November 1, 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, it is out of order. I will reach it in due course. I am correct
that there is a letter of three pages dated November 20, 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 308 is a letter of two pages dated November 30, 1961.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 309 is a letter of two pages dated November 1, 1961.
That is the one to which you have reference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 310 is a Christmas card dated December 11, 1961.</p>

<p>It is contained in an envelope, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is my statement correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 311 is a letter of two pages dated December 14, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 312 is a letter of one page dated December 20, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. December 20, 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Three pages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 313 is a letter of two pages dated January 5, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. January 5, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 314 is a letter of three pages which we have identified,
dated January 30, 1962, and contains the two photographs, one of Marina on the
wedding day and then one of both of them on their wedding day.</p>

<p>Exhibit 315 is a letter of three pages dated February 15, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 316 is a letter of two pages dated March 9, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 317 is a letter of two pages, dated April 12, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Again, on the letter of March 9, 1962, the date on that letter
is the date written by Robert Oswald the day he received that letter. The letter
itself is actually undated. But the envelope is dated by Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct, Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the envelope postmarked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the postmark <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. March 9, 1962, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is date of receipt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 317 is a letter of two pages dated April 12, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 318 is a letter of two pages dated May 22, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 319 is the front and reverse side of a postcard dated October
10, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No, sir. April 10, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the postcard the <span class="locked">witness&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Has previously identified as being in the European tradition of
dating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 320 is a letter of one page dated November 11, 1962. Or
is that '61? Would you check me on that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I don't find that. Is it a letter or a postcard?</p>

<p>That is November 11. That should be November 17, 1962. The photocopy did
not pick up all of it. And if you would like for us, we will change that to
November 17. It should be November 17th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you make that change, please, in ink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is Exhibit No. 320.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit No. 320, a letter of one page, the original
dated November 17th. What year?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Just November 17th. But the postmark shows it was dated
November 18, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit No. 321 is a postcard dated April 10, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To which you have previously referred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have we got a duplication?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are Exhibits 319 and 321 duplicates?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I would have to look at the exhibit. I have the original here
in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are different exhibits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. This is Exhibit 321.</p>

<p>The other one is this one you have here, and it is dated October 10, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. To make sure the record is clear, Mr. Chairman&mdash;Exhibit
No. 319, which is a postcard, is cancelled on its face at Dallas on the
10th day of October 1962, and it reads on the other side, "Dear Robert, for the
new address you can write to Box 2915, Dallas, Texas. Also please stop by the
house and collect any mail which may have come in before the post office had a
chance to change my address to Dallas." And then in the center of the card
"Lee", with two X marks. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that is Exhibit 319.</p>

<p>Now, Exhibit <span class="locked">321&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Let me see. I would like to straighten that out.</p>

<p>Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit No. 321 is the postcard dated April 10, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I might say, Mr. Chairman, I had marked the exhibits correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And I concur in that remark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit No. 322 is a letter of two pages dated March 17, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Dated March 16, 1963. It is postmarked the 17th, but dated
March 16, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibits, Exhibits
295 through 322, both inclusive, the documents that have been marked with
the exhibit numbers so indicated, including the sub-exhibit numbers on the
photographs which have been heretofore identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. They may be received.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked Commission Exhibits 295 through
322, inclusive, and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, if I may, I would like to say something for the
purpose of the record.</p>

<p>Robert Oswald has brought these exhibits voluntarily. They are at the Commission's
convenience at any time. We do not know whether or not they have
been censored in Russia, but we are confident that they were, because some
of the letters refer to the censor in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That will appear, Mr. Chairman, from the photostats of the
exhibits as offered in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. McKenzie, among the original postcards and letters
which you produced for us is a postcard dated January <span class="locked">13&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. January 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. January 10, 1963. And may I have that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir; you may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That will be marked as Commission Exhibit No. 324.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 324 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the witness have the original before him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Examining Commission Exhibit No. 324, which purports to be a
postcard, it is in fact a postcard, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recognize the handwriting on the face and reverse
side of that postcard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose handwriting is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive that postcard in due course or about the cancellation
date appearing on the face of the card?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that cancellation date is January 13, 1963, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that is not correct. It is January 10, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This photostat makes a 10 look like a 13.</p>

<p>This postcard was written to you, sent to you by your brother, Lee Harvey
Oswald, thanking you for a Christmas gift, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the postcard in the same condition now as it was when
you received it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Exactly, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No.
324 the document which we have so marked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may be received.</p>

<p>(The document heretofore marked for identification as Commission Exhibit
No. 324 was received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will return, Mr. Oswald, to the period about which inquiries
were made of you by Representative Ford and Representative Boggs yesterday.
That is, you had testified, as you will recall, of efforts on the part of your
mother to reach your brother by telephone in Russia when news reached America
of his alleged defection. I am merely seeking to orient you at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In due course, you received a letter communication from him, did
you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Including the letter of November 8, 1959, about which I questioned
you yesterday.</p>

<p>Now, I wish to proceed to the next letter, which is the letter of November 26,
1959, a rather long letter.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it consists of eight pages.</p>

<p>Would you get that letter before you, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>I have the letter before me now, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you will note from the letter that it purports to be, and
from its contents it is indicated that your brother Lee is responding to correspondence
that he had in turn received from you.</p>

<p>I ask you this question first.</p>

<p>As to all of these letters which you have now identified this morning, or substantially
all of them, had you been in correspondence with your brother in the
sense that you also wrote him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you by any chance happen to retain a copy of, or copies of
any of the letters you sent him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that at the moment we would have to call solely on your recollection
as to what you might have written during this period of time while he
was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You made no copies of the letters yourself when you sent them&mdash;you
just sent an original? There was no copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, no copies were made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I suggested that you might, during the evening, read the letter
of November 26th so as to refresh your recollection as to whether you had written
him posing questions to which he responded. Have you had that opportunity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not had that opportunity to read this letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would prefer to pass this letter, then, Mr. Chairman, until the
witness does have an opportunity to read it. Would you try and do so at your
first opportunity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It won't take but a minute here to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will recess for lunch at this time.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT EDWARD LEE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 1:15 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You may proceed, Mr. Jenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, I have asked you&mdash;may I inquire of you whether
during the noon hour recess you have read Commission Exhibit 295, which is a
letter of November 26, 1959, from your brother to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you also read the letter that preceded that one, to wit,
the letter of November 8, 1959, which is to you from your brother, which is
Commission Exhibit No. 294?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Chairman, the letter of November 8, which is the
earlier of these two letters&mdash;this was written by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly
after he arrived in Moscow in 1959. In substance, he said in the letter that he
supposed his brother Robert, the witness here, did not wish to speak of his
decision, that is, of Lee Harvey Oswald's decision to remain in the Soviet
Union and apply for citizenship there, since Robert would not be able&mdash;and
now I quote&mdash;"to comprehend my reasons"&mdash;that is Lee Harvey Oswald's reasons.
"You really don't know anything about me. Do you know for instance, that I
have wanted to do this for well over a year? Do you know that I speak a fair
amount of Russian, which I have been studying for months?"</p>

<p>The letter also said that he would not leave the Soviet Union under any
conditions, and would never return to the United States, "which is a country
I hate." He made reference to the fact that he received a telegram from
Robert in which Robert had apparently said that he thought Lee "was making
a mistake."</p>

<p>Now, directing your attention to the November 8 letter first, would you please
state your reaction when you read that letter?</p>

<p>(At this point the letters of November 8, 1959 and November 26, 1959 were
physically set forth in the transcript of testimony. In order to achieve consistency
in the handling of the exhibits upon the printing of the testimony, those
letters are not reproduced in the printed transcript. They are reproduced in
the exhibit section as Commission Exhibits Nos. 294 and 295.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recall my reactions to this letter, sir. It was something I
more or less expected in general, since this was, more or less in general what the
newspapers had been publishing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the only reason you make that remark&mdash;that you had
expected it in general solely because of what you read in the newspapers, or
had there been any other factor that led you to have that expectation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was no other factor that led be to believe that
anything like this was going to happen prior to the happening. My reaction
to the letter, as I have stated, was solely in general expecting from what I
read in the newspaper that the letter would be something of this nature when I
did hear from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any conversation prior thereto during your lifetime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
and that of your brother Lee in which he expressed his views of the character
that he wrote in this letter of November 8, 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I most certainly did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever discussed with him, in any conversation between
you and your brother Lee, with or without your brother John present or your
mother, in which his feeling toward or reaction to the government of the
United States had been discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; at no time, as I stated yesterday, have we ever discussed
politics, and most assuredly I did not have any inclination in any degree
that anything of this nature was in his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So the views expressed by your brother in the letter of November 8
came to you as a complete surprise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; with the qualification that this is what I expected
after reading the newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask one question there.</p>

<p>When your brother left, after that short stay following his service in the
Marine Corps, did you know that he was going to Russia&mdash;did he say anything
to you about going to Russia at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say to you as to his plans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That he was going to New Orleans, Louisiana, to visit my Aunt
Lillian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your Aunt Lillian whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The family you identified yesterday&mdash;the Murret branch of your
family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't recall identifying them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was one occasion yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right. Yes, sir; that is correct. And that he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is an Aunt on which side&mdash;your father's or mother's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother's side. And that he was going to visit with them,
and at the same time find a job in New Orleans, and make his home in New
Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he give you any indication at any time during his stay&mdash;this
was in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During his stay in Fort Worth, upon his return and discharge
from the service, and while he was there, that gave you any indication whatsoever
of any intention on his part to leave the country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; none whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether he was going to go to Europe, Russia, or anywhere
else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. The only information he gave me was that he was
going only to New Orleans, Louisiana, from Fort Worth, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you spend a good deal of time with him while he was in
Fort Worth, Texas, in this interim period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately one day out of the two or three days he was
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you suggesting that most of your contact with him during
this period was on one of those days, or that the total amount of time that
you spent with him during that period aggregated one day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, that I at least talked to him on the telephone
on one day, and then the next day he spent the day at our home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the day that you went off hunting, which you testified
about yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And never during any of the contact that you had with him
did he imply or state directly that he had any contemplation of a trip which
would take him out of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't know about his having applied for a new passport?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not know he applied for any passport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> During the day that he visited you, did your mother visit at
your home on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during the period between his discharge from the
Marines and his arrival in Fort Worth, and his departure, was there any
occasion on which both you, your mother, and your brother Lee were together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion between you at any time during that
period of the reason, if any special reason, for his discharge from the Marine
Corps, earlier than he might have been discharged in normal course, which as
I understand would have been in December of that year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, we had a brief discussion on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who initiated it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel certain like I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did you do? Ask him&mdash;just tell us what you asked
him. And why you were curious, if you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my memory, I asked him&mdash;because I was aware
of his approximate date of discharge, his regular date of discharge, or release
from the service, and I asked him why he was discharged or released earlier
than that date. And his reply was that mother had written the Red Cross
and requested that he be released earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Written the Red Cross?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I <span class="locked">also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say why she had written requesting that he be released
earlier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He just said mother had written the Red Cross asking that he
be released earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't elaborate on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you didn't inquire of him beyond that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When had you last seen your mother prior to this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have his release date, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. September 11, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say approximately three or four months earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three or four months. That would be sometime in May?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you talked with her in the interim period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long prior to his return to Fort Worth on September 11 or
12, 1959, had you talked to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, could you give us an estimate, that is in terms of whether
it was weeks or several months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I can give an estimate of several months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Several months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother was then residing in Fort Worth, was she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was she hospitalized at this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, she was not. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of her state of well being?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the four month period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir? During the four month period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say for three to four months prior to September 11, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
had not seen your mother, that for several months prior to that, you had
not talked with her.</p>

<p>I take it from that that you were not aware of her well being, whether
she was in good health, poor health, or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During the approximate date of three or four months prior
to Lee's release from the service, I was aware that she did have an accident
at her place of employment there in Fort Worth, at which time, if memory
serves me correct, something fell on her, on her face, and injured her nose.</p>

<p>I was aware from conversations with her at that time that she was
consulting or going to various doctors. And she told me at that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Having reached that point&mdash;is that how you
first discovered that your mother had suffered an accident? You say she
told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it, then, that you had not talked with her for
several months prior to September 11 nor seen her before sometime, or later
than sometime in April of 1959, that this telephone conversation must have
taken place several months prior to September 11. Am I correct about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was not a telephone conversation, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the month of April '59?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you visit her, or did she visit you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I saw her at her place of employment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I recited some possibilities&mdash;that
she called you and asked you to come to see her, that you
desired to inquire of her, see if she was all right, or was it that you just
happened to be in the downtown Fort Worth area, and you stopped by
to see her, knowing where she was employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe the latter would possibly be more accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that your best recollection at the moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. She was not employed at that time at the downtown
area of Fort Worth, but rather at a suburb store, Cox's Department
Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is a shoe store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, this is just a large department store, from wearing
apparel to toys, a full line store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you become aware she was employed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long&mdash;did you know then how long she had been
employed at Cox's Department Store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you become aware of the fact she was so employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. About how long was this after the accident, or was it after
the accident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My recollection of that, sir&mdash;this was shortly after the
accident. She was still employed there, even though I understand from our
conversation that day that she had been off for a while&mdash;I don't know how long
a period&mdash;and that she was still employed there. Because this is where
I did see her, at her counter in this department store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On this occasion, when you stopped by to see her, she related
to you an accident she had suffered&mdash;that was the first news you had
of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had not known she was ill or what her state of well being
was prior to that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is the Cox's Department Store located with respect to
your place of business? I am seeking now distance, and the convenience
of getting there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From my place of business at that time in Fort Worth
this was approximately four or five miles west. I might further state,
sir, it was approximately two miles from my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you come from your home to her place of business or
from work to her place of business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I went from home to her place of business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a week day, a working day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I don't believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is not for you. Was it for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was for her, sir, not for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, it was a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would believe that would be correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And has this discussion served to refresh your recollection or
stimulate your recollection now as to why you went by to see her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it has not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I ask you this, sir?</p>

<p>When had you last seen your mother prior to this occasion that you visited
her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not remember, sir. I would say, as we said before, several
months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. That would be several more months, back into the
winter time of 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. '58, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes&mdash;'58.</p>

<p>Well, would it be back in the winter of '58, say January? Or could it have
been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not that long. We are talking, if I am correct, sir,
approximately April of 1959. January of 1958 would be well over a year. It
had not been that long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, then&mdash;I had said January '59, and you said several months.</p>

<p>Now, several months prior to April of 1959, would be or might be as far
back as January of 1959, am I not correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it could be that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your present recollection is that it might have been that
much of a period of time&mdash;sometime in January, 1959, to this occasion in April
of 1959 when you had&mdash;you visited her at Cox's Department Store?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; or possibly even longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Possibly even longer than that. Back into 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you give me your best recollection at the moment as to
the last time you saw your mother in the year 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I cannot recall any specific time during the year of 1958 that
I did see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it be if at all quite infrequent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, quite infrequent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This leads me to put this general question to you, Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>I take it that for some period of time in that area of time&mdash;that is '58, '59,
and perhaps even back of that&mdash;your contact with your mother was quite
limited?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Over what period of time did that persist? Give us the broad
picture first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say, sir, quite frankly that the original occurred prior
to my joining the Marine Corps in 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And persisted thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Persisted thereafter that I saw her only very infrequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your joining the Marine Corps&mdash;was that stimulated in any
respect by your relations with your mother, or your mother's with you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Partly, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the end of the school year of 1952, which was approximately
May 29, <span class="locked">1952&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then 17 years old, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. 18 years old. I, of course, was still living at home. In approximately
the middle part of June 1962 a friend of mine in Fort Worth and I decided
to take a hitch-hiking trip to Florida. We left Fort Worth in the middle
of June, 1962, and <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. '52?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. In June of 1952 we left Fort Worth and traveled I
believed as far as Gulfport, Mississippi. And this friend I was with&mdash;he did
have a defect from birth on one foot that was starting to bother him. And we
decided it was best to return to Fort Worth, by a different route than we originally
left Fort Worth. We went from Fort Worth to Shreveport, New Orleans,
and Gulfport, Mississippi.</p>

<p>Our return was Gulfport, Mississippi, New Orleans, Houston, Big Springs,
Tex., and Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>At that time I stayed at his home, with his mother and himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Because mother and I was having a disagreement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About whether or not I was old enough to start my own life
generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is whether you would depart the family home and live on
your own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, and generally whether or not I had the right to start
my own life in the manner that I wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you unhappy with the manner and fashion of life that you
had led up to that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not in the manner or fashion, sir. I objected quite strongly to
the apparent efforts of our mother to control me completely in all respects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that condition or relationship exist with respect to your
brother, John Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say generally it would, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It did rather than it would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That it did, yes, sir&mdash;thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that a factor in his enlisting in the Coast Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is not to my knowledge that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you and John, then, had had, if I may use my own expression,
difficulties in your relationships with your mother, particularly with
reference to what you gentlemen thought as you reached age 18, as the right
to be independent and lead your own lives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you think that your brother, Lee Oswald, had the same feeling,
that may have affected his joining the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Based on my own personal experience, sir, I would reach that
conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You would?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Did your mother know about this hitch-hiking trip, or did you just go off on
the trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I just went off on the trip, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without advising her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get in touch with her upon your return to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. I would say this. I did attempt to call her
before I left Fort Worth on this trip, and there was no answer at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now what led us back along this trail was the conversation
you had with your brother Lee when he was discharged from the Marines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
on September 11, 1959, and his statement to you that he had an early discharge
because your mother had written a letter to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you saw her in April, and that was the last time you saw
her prior to seeing your brother on his discharge from the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question there.</p>

<p>Do you know whether your brother stimulated this letter from your mother
with regard to early discharge, or do you think she did this on her own, or
don't you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is my understanding, sir, that she had originated the request
to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that understanding is based on what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Just a general feeling that I had at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it induced also by discovering from your brother that your
mother had written a letter to the Red Cross?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sure it was, sir. And I might add I pointed out to Lee why
did you accept this early discharge, since he only had a few months more, I believe
it was, to go. Because it had been my experience in the service that when
I ran across somebody who, for one reason or another, was going to get out
a little bit early, I understood that they perhaps were subject to recall for
that period at a later date, or something along that line. And I thought it was
unwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this what you said to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I pointed out&mdash;I felt like since it was to be under the
regular enlistment period very shortly thereafter, I believe September 11, 1959,
that it would have been the wise thing to stay in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were living in Fort Worth, married, and still you were having
substantially little contact with your mother, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain to the Commission the reasons for that, the
conditions which brought that about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After my marriage to Vada M. Oswald, my mother on a number
of occasions&mdash;I say a number&mdash;perhaps three or four occasions&mdash;made it quite
difficult for my wife and myself when we were in her presence at her apartment
there in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, please, Mr. Oswald&mdash;when you say your mother made it
quite difficult, give us some examples. What do you mean by "made it quite
difficult"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Generally, sir, it was the continuation that, even though I was
married and apparently able to take care of myself and start my own family,
she certainly wanted to&mdash;my mother certainly wanted to&mdash;still control my
thinking, my actions, and my wife's actions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you give us one specific example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I cannot recall any specific examples.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Indicate the nature of those incidents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had she objected to your marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't believe she did, sir. At least I do not recall any time
that she ever stated that, any objections to my marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the feeling that she objected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, to some extent I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a conversation with her about your becoming married
before you became married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she&mdash;what views did she express in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, that would be generally that I was leaving her
alone, that both Lee and John at this time were in the service, and she would be
alone, and that she would like for me to live with her, that I would stay with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was your marriage again, please?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have never stated it before, sir. It was in November&mdash;November
20 or 21, 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The question has been asked of you as to the date of your
marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was in November 1956, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you been courting your present wife prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your mother acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes sir; she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she&mdash;did her objections to your marriage, in addition to
those you stated&mdash;were there any personalities in the sense of her objecting
to your fiance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any feeling that there was any personality in the
sense of objection on her part, or lack of approval of your fiance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I might say, sir, I feel sure there was, and in my mind right
now&mdash;I can think of really no one that she ever approved of to the extent
of my friend, either boys or girls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that also true of your brother, John Pic? And I will also
ask you about Lee Harvey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. John very seldom, if memory serves me correct, ever brought
any of his friends over to the house, to meet mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Presented them to mother, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Presented them to mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that his choice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say so now that I believe it would have been his choice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He preferred not to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be my assumption, that he preferred not to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not presenting his friends to your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you answer the same question as to Lee, as to whether
he brought his friends to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe he did. He quite frequently played around
the house with friends there in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were children, however, in the immediate neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is five years younger than you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. He would have been 13 in 1952, this period we are
talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are interested in this matter of the antipathy existing
between you and John on the one hand and your mother on the other. Had
that gone on for sometime? In order that I don't violate the same thing that
I raise with you occasionally, let me take you back to the military school days,
or to Bethlehem Orphanage. Did a measure of antipathy exist at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I don't believe it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did it really arise in any marked degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe after her divorce from Mr. Ekdahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in June 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And from the time that we moved to the Young Street
address in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At or about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you refresh my recollection as to when that was? Was
that in 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please indicate how that antipathy or that change
was evident? What change of attitude was there, either on the part of you
boys, or on her part, or on the part of all of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps, sir, for the first time in any period, all of us were
together. And perhaps, sir&mdash;I say perhaps this would be correct&mdash;she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
know myself and my older brother John at that particular time to any extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had been away at school pretty much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you had been home for three months in the summertime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. But still, searching my own mind, I certainly
felt this way at that time. And John and I were not accustomed to her. Certainly
I cannot speak for John. But for myself, on that point, I would say
we were not accustomed to her. We had become&mdash;there again I say we&mdash;John
and I&mdash;I feel like I certainly had become more disciplined and used to being
disciplined by men, and not used to having a woman around the house. I believe
this was perhaps my feeling at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, if we can return to the events of April 1959,
did your mother appear to you to have been injured?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What evidence was there of her injury?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There appeared to be a little swelling in the upper part of the
nose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any scratch or other skin break?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; none that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you form an opinion at that time as to whether her injury
was major or minor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I asked her about it, or she volunteered the information of how
the accident occurred, and that she had been seeing doctors, and so forth.
And I did recall her stating to me that she had been to either two or three
doctors, and none of them had said anything was wrong with her, and then
she was insisting that there was definitely something wrong, and she was
continuing to see other doctors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had that sort of thing occurred prior thereto, in which your
mother felt that she was ill and she went to physicians, and the physicians
indicated otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was not chronic in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was she hospitalized at any time in connection with this injury?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she have to give up her work for a period of time, or did she
continue working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe she did miss a short period of time when the accident
occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she was at work on the day you visited her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you forewarned that your brother was returning from the
service earlier than he was scheduled to return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I don't believe I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you forewarned that he was returning at all at this particular
time&mdash;that is, on or about the 11th of September, 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may take a moment, please, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I was not aware that he was being released from the
service earlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you received any communication from him prior to his
return&mdash;that is a communication that was reasonably near the time of his
return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only one that I have a record of, sir, is a letter dated&mdash;postmarked
June 6, 1959, at Santa Ana, California, addressed to me at my
Fort Worth address of 7313 Davenport, return address, Pfc. L.&nbsp;H. Oswald,
Santa Ana, California. The letter itself is undated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have made reference, Mr. Oswald, to a letter you received
in an envelope postmarked June 6, 1959, from your brother. You have the
original of that letter before you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that letter&mdash;did you receive in addition to this letter
until September 11, 1959, any other letter from your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I can recall, sir, or that I have record of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this letter in the third paragraph reads, "Well, pretty
soon I will be getting out of the Corps, and I know what I want to be and how
I am going to be it, which I guess is the most important thing in my life"&mdash;"in
life." Have I read it correctly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You have, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you respond to that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my recollection did I respond to the letter, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when your brother was mustered out, on or about September 11,
1959, did you have a discussion with him with respect to this subject
matter&mdash;that is what he wanted to be in life, and how he was going to go about
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not&mdash;to this extent. He did, of course, indicate
to me that he wanted to go to New Orleans, Louisiana, and live and find a job
there, and he did not indicate what type of job or what type of work he wanted
to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record, Mr. Chairman, this letter has
been identified and is in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 296.</p>

<p>How did you learn that your brother was in Fort Worth, upon his being
mustered out of the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, he called me on arrival at Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the first notice or knowledge that you had that he had
been discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his call to you was the first notice or knowledge you had
that he was in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It necessarily follows, and I take it it is a fact, that your mother
had not called you to advise you that he was being discharged or would be
discharged at or about that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I can remember, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Might I ask you at this point whether your brother ever talked
to you about his experience in the Marines. Did he tell you anything about that,
give you any incidents? I think you only had one day&mdash;that would have taken
place on that one day, between the three or four days between his return and
going off again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or may I add, Mr. Chairman, any correspondence he had in the
Marines, and any leaves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We have no letters, have we, from the witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, but I thought there might possibly be some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't want to interrupt, but it seemed to me to fit in at this
particular point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall, other than general discussion, about the Marine
Corps. I recall&mdash;and I believe this was on his leave in 1958, when we discussed
this&mdash;I had asked him did he know any of my drill instructors, and I at the
time recalled a senior drilling instructor at Camp Pendleton, by the name of
Sgt. Cobie. And he stated he did not. However, he did run across, while he
was in boot camp, some other drill instructor, but he could not recall his name,
who stated he recalled me, or asked him one day did he have a brother that
had been in the Marine Corps a few years before. He said yes, he had. And
apparently this man did remember me, because he asked was I the right guide
in that platoon. And my brother Lee did not know that I was. I do recall that
conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any other conversation with him or any correspondence
from him in which the subject matter of his career in the Marines
was discussed, or to which allusion was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I certainly received other letters during the course of his enlistment
in the United States Marine Corps. I do not recall any specific instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
that reflected what his opinion was of the Marine Corps, nor that at any time I
remember did he refer to any happenings or incidents while he was in the Marine
Corps that perhaps might upset him, or might have made him happy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing either way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Completely bland in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall whether any of those letters are available now?
Do you have those letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I believe I do not have those. I say I believe I do not.
I have looked for just everything that I could possibly find on Lee's life, and
letters and so forth, and I have not run across any others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to ask you that. You have made a thorough search?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If you should find them, you will make them available to us,
will you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Certainly, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Just one more question on that, if I may. I would gather that the correspondence
you had during his stay in Russia was more voluminous than
while he was in the Marine Corps, from what you tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it certainly was. There was certainly a larger flow of
letters from him, and from me to him, at this time than there was during his stay
in the United States Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So while he was in Russia, he wrote you considerably more often,
at least after the first year, I guess it was, or nine months, than he had theretofore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. If I might there again refer to the letters from Russia
received from Lee Harvey Oswald and placed in evidence before this Commission,
when he notified us in 1959 that he was no longer going to write or contact
us, and did not want us to contact him in any way, it was until April of 1961
before I heard from him again, which was, of course, a period of time after one
year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you written him in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know where he was in the meantime&mdash;that is, any particular
town or city in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you had the impression that he did not want you to write to
him at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Dulles, he says that in the letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes&mdash;one of these letters I am about to examine him about so
states.</p>

<p>That is correct, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, however, that in contrast, commencing with the
letter in 1961, April I believe you said it was&mdash;from that time forward, there
was, by comparison, a considerable number of letters, and a larger volume of
correspondence than you had ever had from your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, there was a continuous flow. Realizing the period that
it would take to make a complete cycle of the exchange of one letter to another,
of approximately two weeks&mdash;the letters were quite regular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this had not been the pattern even in prior years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he was in the Marine Corps, or when you were in the
Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Confirmatory of that, Mr. Oswald, I note in Commission Exhibit
No. 296, is the last paragraph which reads, "I know I haven't written in a long
time. Please excuse me. Well, there really isn't too much news here. But I
would like to hear from you and the family. Write soon. Your brother, Lee".<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
I take it from that that there had been&mdash;this was the first communication
you had had from him, as he says, in a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your memory serve you sufficiently now to define more
clearly the period to which he refers as "a long time"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say in between the leave in 1958, and his letter received,
postmarked in June 1959, I would not have received over two or three letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His leave in '58 was when, again, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recall this to be in the early fall of the year&mdash;perhaps September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Directing your attention now back to the letter of
November 8, 1959, which is Commission Exhibit 294, I will ask you this: Is this
the first letter you received from him from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it the first communication of any kind, at least directly from
or initially by him, that you had from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is, then, the first time you heard from him from the day he
departed to go to New Orleans, as he had stated to you, for the purpose of finding
employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified yesterday that you responded to this letter&mdash;that is,
Commission Exhibit 294, dated November 8, 1959. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were unable to recall particularly well yesterday your letter
in response to Commission Exhibit 294. Has the reading of the letter of November
26, 1959, which is Commission Exhibit 295, and your re-reading of the
letter of November 8, Commission Exhibit 294, served to refresh your recollection
as to the contents of your letter which you wrote in response to Commission
Exhibit 294?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To some degree, sir, it most certainly has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Would you now, having had your recollection refreshed,
relate to us as near as may be, if you are able to do so, your letter in
response to your brother's letter, Commission Exhibit 294?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Which was the letter of November 8&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my recollection, in my response to his letter, I
asked him why he went to Russia, and for what purpose he went to Russia.
And I believe, sir, that is to the best of my ability, in the remembrance of my
letter, that would be the only two questions that I asked him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in the letter of November 8, he says, "Do you know, for
instance, that I have wanted to do this for well over a year"&mdash;that is, go to
Russia. I take it from your prior testimony that you had not known, either
well over a year or even for an instant, that he had any intention of going to
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had the name Albert Schweitzer College ever been mentioned
by your brother Lee prior to this time&mdash;that is, let us say, prior to the middle
of September 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He also states in this letter of November 8&mdash;makes the rhetorical
question&mdash;"Do you know that I speak a fair amount of Russian, which I have
been studying for many months". Had that subject matter ever come to your
attention prior to his uttering it in the letter of November 8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not know, up until this time, that your brother had been
studying Russian while in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. And again if I may elaborate on that, I was
not aware that he ever studied any foreign language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did your brother ever talk to you about what he was reading
during this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or at any time, during his school period?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. Of course, I have seen him read various books. I never
did see him read a book&mdash;unless the covers&mdash;or perhaps if I picked it up&mdash;it didn't
indicate anything about communism or socialism. He did like to read. He
read quite a bit. And by this, I have observed him to read anything from funny
books to novels, to westerns, the full scope. He liked American history. I
have seen him read American history a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a voracious reader? That is, did he read a great deal,
devote much attention to reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he was what I would term an assiduous reader.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am directing your attention to his&mdash;oh, say, from age, let's say,
nine or ten to the time he enlisted in the Marines&mdash;maybe we better go back
a little bit more, since you were away. I would like to cover his youth up to
the time he enlisted in the Marines. Is that the period of which you speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not. I speak of a later period&mdash;my visit to New
Orleans after I received my discharge from the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And before he enlisted in the marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; before he enlisted in the Marine Corps. And of his
moving to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With mother&mdash;in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On these occasions you observed him reading assiduously?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had an opportunity, and you embraced it to some extent,
just out of curiosity if nothing else, of observing the nature and character of
the literature and the subject matter of the literature he was reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is of the nature and the subject matter you already stated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During any of that period, and any observation you ever made
whether then or prior thereto, had you noticed him or seen any books&mdash;he uses
the expression "Marxism", communism&mdash;or any books or works, or pamphlets
of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not. I did not at any time observe him reading
or have in his possession any type of pamphlet or book, should I say, of a
political nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even American politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. American politics, of course&mdash;American history, of course, would
go into some degree of American politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you are probably right. But other than American
history.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not observe him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your brother states in this letter of November 8, the
United States was a country that he hated. Taking the whole letter, we would
like to have you state what your reaction to the letter was when you received
it and read it, in view of the rather severe things he says, and startling things
he says in this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir, refer to my testimony yesterday in relation to
this letter, and my reactions then, I thought more along that line. I have
not come up with any other conclusions where my thinking as to my reaction
at the time I received the letter&mdash;other than it was something that I expected, due
to what I had read in the newspapers prior to receiving the letter of November 8,
1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your shock, if I may call it such, had been <span class="locked">conditioned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To some degree it had; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, then, the letter, when you did receive it, with
these utterances in it, did not surprise you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel, perhaps, if anything would have surprised me that did
not appear, to my recollection, would be the statement "I will never return to
the United States, which is a country I hate," particularly the latter part of
that statement&mdash;"which is a country I hate."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That did shock you despite your having read the newspaper
clippings or articles?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I feel certain that it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in your response to your brother's letter, did you advert
to that particular portion of his letter? To the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;I was just making a note on that. I didn't realize
you would ask me that so soon. I do believe I asked him why he hated the
United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, have you given us&mdash;exhausted your recollection as to the
content of the letter you wrote in response to the letter of November 8, Commission
Exhibit 294?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I feel I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, now, let us turn, if we might, to Letter No. 26, which is
Exhibit 295, an eight-page letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, to summarize this letter, if I may, for you, it
is an eight-page letter. Lee Harvey Oswald sets forth in it extensively his
philosophies, what they purport to be as of that time, the reasons why he
has decided to defect to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>He complained about the economic system in the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. System?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. System&mdash;which he stated exploited all of its workers.</p>

<p>He complained of segregation and unemployment, and automation in the
United States.</p>

<p>He stressed disapproval of American foreign policy, which he characterized
as being one of imperialism. In framework, it is framed as a response partly
to some questions that our present witness has posed in a letter, which Mr.
Robert Oswald had written in response to the letter of November 8, such as
a question as to why Lee Harvey Oswald and his fellow workers and communists
would like to see the present capitalist system of the United States overthrown&mdash;he
having made an indication to the witness in that respect.</p>

<p>Apparently in Robert's letter to Lee, he had couched it in terms of suggesting
that apparently Lee Harvey Oswald thought he might have some advantage
economically if he went to Russia, and Lee Harvey Oswald responded, "So
you speak of advantages. Do you think that is why I am here, for personal
material advantages? Happiness is not based on one's self, does not consist
of a small home, of taking and getting. Happiness is taking part in a struggle
where there is no borderline between one's own personal world and the world
in general. I never believed I would find more material advantages at this
stage of development in the Soviet Union than I might have had in the United
States."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. At this point, Mr. Chairman, I might also add, in connection
with what Mr. Jenner has stated about this letter, that the letter appears, in
answering questions that Robert may have posed in a previous letter to Lee
Harvey Oswald&mdash;it appears to have been lifted in some respects out of a communist
text, and it even appears to me&mdash;and this is pure supposition, that it could
possibly have been written by someone else with Lee Harvey Oswald coming back
in and adding other things to it. It is the longest letter received, consisting of
some eight pages. A careful reading of the letter will show only one or two
misspelled words, whereas in the other letters there are a number of misspelled
words.</p>

<p>And I don't know what that adds or detracts from the record. But I do feel
that there is a difference in the letters as you read all of them put together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am glad you called that to our attention. It is an interesting
observation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And I would like to, if I may, point out something I observed
in between the letter of November 8, 1959, and the letter of November 26, 1959.</p>

<p>In the letter of November 8, 1959, towards the last paragraph on the last
page, I quote, "I really don't see what we could talk about. If you want to
send me money, that I can use. But I do not expect to be able to pay it back."</p>

<p>I now refer to the letter of November 26, 1959, on the last page, the second
last paragraph, "I have no money problems at all"&mdash;underlined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
"My situation was not really as stable then as it is now. I have no troubles
at all now along that line."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And, furthermore, he had moved from Room 233 in the Metropole
Hotel to Room 201 in the Metropole Hotel. And marks on the letter of
November 26th, "Note new room number."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I get into the record here, just for clarification&mdash;when was
this written in relation to his arrival in the Soviet Union? Do we have that on
the record? Was it a month after? Was it before the other incident that has
been described for the record, with regard <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir; I believe I can answer that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I didn't want to hazard a guess. If you know, will you please
state it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe Lee, as a matter of record, did arrive in the Soviet
Union on October 13, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is it written then, roughly, a little less than a month and&mdash;a
little over a month after his arrival&mdash;these two letters referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I intended to draw your attention to that which you have already
mentioned&mdash;that is, in the letter of November 8 he indicated that he would be
pleased if you would send him some funds, whereas on the last page of the letter
of November 26th he advises you that as far as funds are concerned&mdash;he is in
good shape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And both of these letters were written, as I recall, before he was
advised that he could not stay on in the Soviet Union the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct, sir. They are written before he went to Minsk,
as well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you sent him any funds in the interim period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Referring to my testimony yesterday&mdash;at which time I replied to his letter of
November 8, 1959, on his request for any money that I might send him, I stated
to him I would gladly send him the necessary money for his return to the United
States, and for that reason only.</p>

<p>I did not enclose any money in my answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that is an interesting factor about which I would like to
inquire of you; also, as to its implication.</p>

<p>Later, your brother, as the correspondence we have now introduced in evidence
discloses, desired to return to the United States. And he was having, according
to the correspondence, some problem in raising the necessary funds to return
to the United States.</p>

<p>Did he at any time write you requesting that you honor your letter in response
to his letter of November 8th in which you said you would gladly send him
money to return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not request it directly. He had certainly indicated,
as his letters do indicate, that he was having a little difficulty in raising
the necessary funds to return to the United States. And I, in my reply to that
letter, volunteered to raise the necessary funds to bring his wife and himself to
the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify the particular letter to which you now refer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In reply to your question, sir, I am referring to the letter of
February 15, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which, for the record, is Commission Exhibit 315.</p>

<p>Did you respond to that letter and offer to advance to him the funds necessary
to bring about his return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did. And I also included an offer for him to stay
with us on his return to the United States, he and his family, for any length
of time that they so desired, until he was able to get settled himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever receive from him a letter in which he responded
directly to your offer to advance funds?</p>

<p>Perhaps I will put it this way. Have you produced all of the letters that you
received from him while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my knowledge this is all of the letters I received from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make it a practice during this period to keep, intentionally
and deliberately keep, all letters that you received from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that was my intention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your knowledge you have produced all of those
letters to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever report to your brother that it would be necessary
for you to make a loan on your automobile in order to advance any funds to
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Including particularly the $200 that you advanced to him when
he returned in June of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become aware at any time prior to November 22, 1963,
that he made a representation to the New York welfare authorities that it would
be necessary for you to make a loan on your automobile to advance the $200?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no discussion of that subject by him with you when
he returned to Fort Worth and lived in your home, or thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. This is the first knowledge I have of such a report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, returning to the letter of November 26&mdash;and keeping in mind, also, the
letter&mdash;let's just stay with the letter of November 26th.</p>

<p>Prior to the time of the receipt of that letter, had your brother Lee ever in
your presence uttered thoughts of that nature, or even spoken to you any
thoughts of the nature contained in the letter of November 26th with respect
to the United States, its economic system, Communist Russia, or countries of
that character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was your reaction to the letter of November 26, particularly
those features of it dealing with his attitudes towards the United
States and its political and economic and social system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I remember somewhat vividly my reply to him&mdash;my reply
to his <span class="locked">letter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did reply to the letter of November 26th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please state what your reply was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did reply to the letter of November 26, 1959, and it was&mdash;and
I believe until this day remains to be the longest letter I ever wrote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right&mdash;tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I answered all the questions as to&mdash;if I may refer to the first
question.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time you told me about the efforts of your milk company
to form a union? Try to see why workers must form unions against employers
in the United States."</p>

<p>I recall I did reply to that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was my opinion&mdash;and I am not anti-union or pro-union. I believe
it should be taken on the basis of the individual companies. It was my
opinion that I expressed to him at that time that in this country, the employees
did have a right to vote yes or no whether or not they wanted a union, and in
this particular instance, the union was voted out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could we just have a moment's pause?</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Will you proceed?</p>

<p>Is it all right to proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were reciting what you said in your letter of response to
the letter of November 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir, if I may pause a moment to locate the second
question or some statement that perhaps I recall referring to directly in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
reply&mdash;I recall replying to the statement that was, that is contained, on the
second page of the letter of November 26, to the latter part of this statement
that I will quote from: "See the segregation, see the unemployment and what
automation is. Remember how you were laid off at Convair?"</p>

<p>I am referring now to the last question of "Remember how you were laid off
at Convair?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I pointed out to him at that time that this was something
I was aware of when I accepted the job at Convair in Fort Worth, Texas.
It was a condition, perhaps an unspoken condition, because it was a government
job in that when I was laid off, I did not have to go only to the government to look
for employment but I was able to secure the type of employment that I was
most interested in at that time or that he had a variety to choose from and
that no one would say to me that, "You work here or there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you experience any bitterness in being laid off at Convair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Resentful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My reaction since I have been laid off at Convair and when I
was laid off at Convair I felt like it was the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did that event take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In August, 1957, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Proceed with your recollection of your reply to this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir, continue to answer something along the question
of how I felt or reacted to my layoff at Convair; the reason why I recall the
date is because my daughter was born two or three days after I was laid off,
and I knew I was going to be laid off before she was born and I did not tell my
wife and I recall that quite vividly.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think I will ask you an additional question about that, if I may,
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion, at least in Lee's presence, regarding
your being laid off at Convair and your attitude with respect thereto.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; none that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was he&mdash;let's see, 1957, he was in the Marines then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then sometime along the line you had advised him that
you were no longer with Convair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I feel certain like I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps you wrote him to that effect or you told him about it
when he was on leave in 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would feel like perhaps I wrote him about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the best of your recollection did you indicate any resentment
or bitterness in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. As I have never been resentful to that or bitter about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that at least, as far as you can recall, any statement you made
or any attitude you have with respect to your layoff which might have come to
his attention, did not form a basis for his predicating the Convair comment, on
which he might have predicated the Convair comment, in his letter of
November 26?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I <span class="locked">also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, if I asked you a similar line of questions with respect
to the union question would your answer be the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; It certainly would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never expressed any dislike of unions. You never expressed
to him, or in his presence, or members of your family, views that unions were
exploited?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>By the way, had there been any discussion in the course of your youth, as
you boys grew up, expressions in your family of any of these attitudes that he is
expressing in his letter of November 8 and his letter of November 26?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. To my knowledge there was never any type of discussion
that would reflect any of the statements or questions that he wrote in his letter
of November 26, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say to the extent there were discussions among you,
and your family life, that the contrary was expressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall any discussions, sir, but if there was any discussion
it would have been to the contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your family was always a typical, loyal American family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, loyal to the Government of the United States and you
thought well of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When I say, you, I mean all of the members of your family as
far as you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Proceed with your recollection of your response.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I refer to his statement in the letter of November 26 on the
second page, "I can still see Japan and the Philippines and their puppet governments.
More important, I can see the Americans in uniform, men who were
there because they were drafted or because they were adventurers or unemployed
in civilian life."</p>

<p>I referred to my own volunteering in the United States Marine Corps at that
time, and I felt that nothing he pointed out there applied to my case, and I felt
quite a few other men felt as I did, as to the reasons behind their joining the
United States service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you expressed any dissatisfaction to him with your tour
in the Marines, or was that subject discussed in family councils or visits on his
part to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. May I for just a moment?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Would you repeat the question, I believe I had it; I want to be
sure of it.</p>

<p>(The question was read.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not believe that at any time we discussed it. We
might have mentioned my tour in the United States Marine Corps. He was
very proud of my service record and it would so indicate that I conducted
myself in the best tradition of the United States Marine Corps; not that I was
any lily white, but I was never in any serious trouble and I progressed in rank
in keeping with the period that I was in the United States Marine Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had that thought been expressed, or at least that flavor left, with
the members of your family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel that it was, particularly to Lee, because <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate on that, please; we are interested in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Because I feel very surely that the reason that Lee
joined the United States Marine Corps was because of my service in the United
States Marine Corps and he wanted to <span class="locked">follow&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your reaction to it had been communicated by you to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel like it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Many witnesses have a habit that you have when you feel like
it was. Do you mean that you actually conveyed that thought to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>I believe I was stating that I believe that the reason that Lee joined the
United States Marine Corps was to follow in my footsteps, in that same service,
and frankly I believe that at that time in earlier years and later years that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
looked up to me, not only in that respect, but that eventually he wanted to follow
in my footsteps.</p>

<p>I would say within the family relation that Lee and I were closer than Lee
and mother or Lee and John during our entire lifetime. That if there was something
that he was going to discuss with anybody, or say to anybody, within the
family I would be the one that he would discuss it with.</p>

<p>I refer to his statement on the second page of the letter of November 26, 1959,
"I will ask you a question, Robert, what do you support the American government
for? What is the ideal you put forward. Do not say freedom because
freedom is a word used by all people through all of time."</p>

<p>I did refer to the word "freedom" and I recall stating to him that the word
"freedom" to me was something that was earned and not handed down.</p>

<p>I refer to the third page of the letter of November 26, 1959, and the brief
statement, "America is a dying country."</p>

<p>I replied to him that perhaps, and I believe some great man said this statement
at one time or the other, I do not recall who, that we were a sleeping giant,
and that we were coming awake.</p>

<p>This was, of course, in reference to the Communist world.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was something you said in your letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask what is the date of this letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is in response to the letter of November 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. November 26, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I refer to the bottom of the page of the letter of November 26,
"So you speak of advantages. Do you think that is why I am here for personal
material advantages, happiness is not based on oneself, it does not consist of a
small home of taking and getting."</p>

<p>I recall my reply to this series of questions as being&mdash;as to having that
right to seek for oneself his own personal desires to the extent that the material
advantages were something of a secondary nature, and was something of a
reward for his efforts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While the witness is looking further, Mr. Chairman, this is a
little tedious, but as counsel for the Commission, I suggest its importance and
relevancy in that, if nothing else, it serves to demonstrate the response of the
witness to the letter indicating the attitude of the Oswald family on these subjects
and isolating these views to Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think this is important, and the more I hear of this letter the
more I get the impression that there was some help given in writing this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is why I am spending so much time on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With apologies to you, Mr. McKenzie, that is the only way we
can go at it because we don't have the actual response itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, I commend you on the way that you are conducting
this interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Oswald, under no circumstances speculate on what you
wrote in answer to these letters. State to the best of your recollection only
what you did write, if you recall.</p>

<p>If you can't recall tell Mr. Jenner so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, this is what I have been doing, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In view of the importance of this letter of November 26 and
certain other of these letters, as Chairman and in view of the absence of a number
of my colleagues today for unavoidable reasons, I think it might be well to insert
the entire letter in the record and possibly certain other letters on which you are
going to interrogate the witness.</p>

<p>You see no objection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. None whatsoever, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have in mind that other members of the Commission may not be
able to read all of the exhibits but I think they should read these letters on
which we are interrogating the witness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In order to get the full purport, flavor of this particular line of
interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I couldn't concur more, Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will leave it then to your discretion with Mr. Rankin to
decide what letters should go in, in connection with his testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I might add in that regard, Mr. Chairman, that I have no
objection, whatsoever to any or all of the letters going into the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are already in the record. But you mean set forth in full
in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I would mark right now the spot in the record following the
Chairman's remarks and my concurrence and, of course, Mr. Jenner's suggestion
that the letter be in its entirety placed in the record, I would mark that place
now so that it could go in at this spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also the letter of November 8. And November 26 letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed, Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall any other statements that I would have replied
to, or did reply to, in my reply to his letter of November 26, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Now, did you receive any direct response to your letter, and your next letter
is Commission Exhibit No. 296, sometime during the summer of 1959, it is a short
one-page letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This is December, 1959, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, it is in the summer of 1959, isn't it, or is that the one-page
letter which you had written December 17, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the next letter you received from your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there any reference in that letter to the response you made to
the November 26 letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. There is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive any subsequent letter in which he made any
direct response to your long letter which you wrote him in response to the
letter of November 26?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he did not, and if I might say I wrote earlier and as a
reminder to myself that I was concerned at the time I received the letter of
December 17, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Commission Exhibit 297.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That Lee did not have time to receive my reply to his letter of
November 26, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Then the next letter you received, at least in the series you have produced, is
May 5, 1961, a two-page letter, Commission Exhibit 298.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Could I have that date again, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May 5, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He makes no response in that letter to your response to his letter
of November 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he does not. Perhaps, sir, the only way that I can be
aware that he received my letter in reply to November 26 letter, to his letter
of November 26, 1959, I did enclose one photograph of my daughter Cathy Marie
Oswald at the age of 2 years old in that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your response to his letter of November 26?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; and at a later date Lee was to tell me that he did
keep this photograph, so he did receive my letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you repeat what you just said, sir, or would you read it,
Mr. Reporter?</p>

<p>(The reporter read the answer.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said Lee was to tell you, did you mean by that expression
that he actually acknowledged receipt of the photograph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which leads you to believe necessarily then that he received your
response to his letter of November 26.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he state that he had received that photograph in a letter
that he wrote you or was that orally after he returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this was orally, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After he returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, returning to his short stay at Fort Worth upon his being
discharged from the Marines, what do you recall, if anything, of any discussion
respecting his financial status at that time, that is whether he was in funds
and if so, what volume of funds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was not aware of his financial situation at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any member of the family, during that period of time, ever
discuss with you, having in turn discussed that subject matter with Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have a conversation with your mother prior to
November 22, 1963 respecting Lee's financial status at the period of time when
he was immediately&mdash;right at the time he was discharged from the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. I do not remember one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that up to November 22, 1963, there was never any discussion
in which you participated or which you overheard on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, with respect to the remaining series of letters, were you
ever advised while your brother Lee was in Russia how much money he was
given or earned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. While he <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or he received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. While he was in Russia employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While he was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. While he was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either from his employment or by gift.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there is a reply in one of these letters that I received
from Lee from Russia stating how much he was making while employed in
Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The letter will, of course, be the best evidence of that. Did
he say it in terms of dollars or in terms of rubles, what is your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In both, sir. I believe he stated it in the words rubles and in
parentheses in the amount of American dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see, we will find that out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And I believe on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever write you as to whether he had received any money
by way of gift from any agency in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, I respectfully submit that the letters themselves
would be the best evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are undoubtedly correct and I will desist.</p>

<p>Did you have any discussion with him on that subject after he returned
from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or on the subject of his earnings in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive any packages or gifts from Russia while your
brother was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you receive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And give the approximate times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There again, sir, there is a letter from Lee in Russia stating
that he had sent a gift or gifts to us at my residence in Fort Worth, Tex. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
recall that on two occasions we received gifts from Russia at my address in Fort
Worth, Tex. I believe the first one consisted of Russian cigarettes, Russian
candy, six place mats or six napkins that Marina had embroidered herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Or at least what they told you Marina had embroidered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And also a Russian wooden doll, the type that pops
open in the middle and has a smaller doll on the inside and so forth down the
line until you end up with one approximately an inch high from one originating
from one six or seven inches high. That was the first package that I recall
receiving from Lee and his wife while they were in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Approximately when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Prior to Christmas of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was a second occasion when you received a package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was closer to Christmas of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it contained what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It contained one Russian children's book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the Russian language or in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the Russian language, sir, and going by the cover of the book
and as you open the book in the center section, a Russian rocket ship would unfold
and be standing in the launch position, and was quite evident by the pictures,
at least in the book, that this was a book for Russian children depicting
the Russian efforts toward their space program.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you still have that book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do. And there was also another children's book, and
I believe this package only consisted of a present for Cathy Marie Oswald for
Christmas, 1961 from her aunt and uncle, Lee and Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A child's gift?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, and the second book was a child's coloring book, a Russian
coloring book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that exhaust your recollection as to gifts you received from
them or from Lee while they were in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever send you a pair of boots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he did not. And I might add we also still have the
child's coloring book that was received at that time for Christmas, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Now, would you please relate to us everything that your brother Lee told you
about hunting in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You mean other than in correspondence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean other than by the correspondence. I should precede
that by the question did you have any conversation with him about hunting in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that occurred after he returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the approximate date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately the latter part of June, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While he was residing in your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say? Excuse me, this occurred in your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anyone present other than yourself and your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps Marina and my wife Vada. As I best remember the
conversation, since our interest in hunting was mutual, that he had on two
or three occasions gone bird hunting or duck hunting and that he had killed some
birds and some ducks on two or three of these occasions that he had gone in,
that he had only used a shotgun, that they were not allowed to have a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion of that subject matter on any other
occasion prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe in his <span class="locked">letters&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, discussions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, no, sir; there was not, not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion with him during the period from
his return in June of 1962 up to November 22, 1963, of his membership in a
gun club while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any discussion occur between you as to his membership in
any other group while he was in Russia, whether it was a gun club, a social
club, a labor union or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In one of the letters, your brother Lee asked you whether, to
check to see if, the United States had any, lodged any charges against him.</p>

<p>Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Briefly, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do when he made that request to you, if any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recall replying to his letter and stated that to my knowledge,
and I could see no reason why they would have any charges against him for
going to Russia, because he was an American citizen, and he was free to do
as he chooses as long as it was not harmful to the United States Government
and I didn't feel like he had done anything harmful to the United States Government
by going to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever write in any of the letters that you wrote him,
did you raise the question with him of whether he had in fact renounced or
attempted to renounce his United States citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was advised that, at the time, that we became aware that
Lee was in Russia by newspaper correspondents in Fort Worth, Tex., that the
United States Embassy acting on their own accord, would not allow him to
sign any final papers denouncing his United States citizenship. Whether he
wanted to or not they were attempting to prevent him from doing this. I never
did hear any more about that. Perhaps during the correspondence or on his
return from Russia, this was certainly evident that he had not signed any final
papers denouncing his United States citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your response, sir, that you did not raise that
matter with him in any letters that you wrote to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my recollection, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion with him on the subject on his
return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Possibly so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that distinctly at the moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother Lee raise again with you, following your
response to his request that you investigate whether or not there were any
other charges against him; did he raise again with you the question of whether
you had made an investigation, whether there were charges?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. When you say did he raise <span class="locked">again&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time subsequent thereto, that is apart from the correspondence
which has been introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. There are several instances in the correspondence, Mr. Jenner,
there are questions raised about this.</p>

<p>Are you talking about after he returned from&mdash;to the United States from
the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir; I am at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he returned to the United States and while he was living
with you, was there or were there any occasions in which there was discussion
of his trip back from Russia and the course they took in returning to the
United States, the means and manner of return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give us your recollection of what that discussion was and
what your brother and/or Marina said to you and your wife Vada or either
of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recall asking him how his trip was from Russia to New York
City by boat. I asked him what route they had traveled, and he advised me
then, that is as I believe he advised me in one of his letters, the first one, was
to go from Minsk to Moscow and then from Moscow to Holland, I believe, to
board a ship that touched at England, and from England to New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he or <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is a conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any conversation with Marina on this subject
or in her presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I recall, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did state specifically that they had gone to Moscow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And from Moscow to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To Holland, if my memory serves me correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say, did he indicate, how they had traveled from Moscow
to Holland, by what means of conveyance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said about how long they stayed in Moscow before
they took off for Holland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In this discussion, I do not recall that he did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he say how long they stayed in Holland, if they stayed
there at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall his stating specifically they touched England
in the sense that the <span class="locked">ship&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; for supplies or for some other reason, it appeared
not to be, I say appeared, I assume it was not a very long stay there and that
they did not leave the ship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did state that they did not leave the ship at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; this is an assumption on my part&mdash;the way he put it
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they proceeded from there directly to New York Harbor,
New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By what means? And he did report that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this series of letters you received in the early portion, period
of his stay in Russia excite your suspicions as to whether he was or might be
a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I understand the question correctly this was the early stay
of his in Russia in 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir, 1959 and let us say to the early part of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any occasion to discuss that subject during this
period of time with your mother or she with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Prior to his return in 1961 she did discuss this with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Where did this discussion take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may fix the date approximately, sir, if you could give me
the date of her trip to Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have me at a disadvantage because Mr. Liebeler has been
called out and he can furnish that. I don't want to guess at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. May I then ask if possibly the Chairman might recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The date of that visit to Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No, I don't think I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Possibly Mr. Rankin might know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Our information was that that was January 26, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you, sir. If I may have, the question again, please.</p>

<p>(The question was read by the reporter.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether the suspicions, on the part of yourself or your mother,
were that your brother was or might be an agent for the Russian Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, sir, I believe I misunderstood. I thought it was in
reference to whether or not Lee might have been an agent of the United States
Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. It was the Russian Government I asked about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry, sir. At no time was any discussion that I have been
into indicated that in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have referred then to, or had in mind, a conversation
with your mother as to whether your brother was an agent of the United States
Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And are you able to fix the time of that discussion now having
been supplied with the date when your mother visited Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately the spring of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Several months following her visit to Washington in January,
1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did that discussion take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this was a telephone conversation, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you call her or did she call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She called me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you recognized her voice, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That she told me briefly about her trip to Washington, and
that she, as she put it, had seen various important people, and that she was
reaching or coming to the conclusion that Lee was an agent of one sort or
another for the United States Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you respond to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall, sir, that I did; if so, what my response might
have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall whether you responded, and if you did, you
don't recall your response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, have you given us now all your conversations you had
with your mother on the subject of whether your brother, that is up to November
22, 1963, as to whether your brother was or might have been an agent of
the Government of the United States or an agent of any other government including
that of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you received these letters, particularly the series of letters
in 1961, up to the first of January, 1962, did there occur to you the thought that
your brother was or might be an agent of the Russian Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it most certainly did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at any time thereafter up to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it has not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any contact with the State Department or did
the State Department have any contact with you at any time while your
brother was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, I believe the record will show there was a previous
telegram to Mr. Christian Herter who was Secretary of State at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than the telegram you testified about yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any conversations with your mother respecting
her contacts, if any, with the State Department during the period of
time your brother was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you at any time prior to November 22, 1963, no, I will include
that date, let's say at any time prior to December 1, 1963, have
any view or suspicion that Marina Oswald was or might have been an agent of
the Russian Government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the letter of July 14, 1961, being Commission Exhibit 301,
your brother expresses or states, makes some derogatory comments respecting
Russia. Is that the first information or knowledge that you had
of any change of attitude on his part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Indicate the prior event that gave you some suspicion in
that connection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I understand it correctly, sir, whether or not had I had
any prior indication prior to receiving the letter of July 14, 1961, that Lee
was <span class="locked">becoming&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Disenchanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Disenchanted with the Russian way of life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When I received his first letter from Russia after a year
or so of <span class="locked">silence&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give the date of the letter.</p>

<p>There is a break between December 17, 1959 and May 5, 1961.</p>

<p>Is it the letter of May 5 of 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am referring to the letter of May 5, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. It is Commission Exhibit 299.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It indicated to me, whether it so states in there or not, because
he did start writing again that he was in fact disenchanted with
the Russian way of life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the first letter you received after Lee had gone to Minsk,
is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is the first letter you received following the undated
letter of, in December, 1959, but that you have noted was received on the
17th of December, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then the subsequent letters heightened your impression
of suspicion that he was becoming&mdash;either was completely or was
becoming, disenchanted with Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, in his letter it certainly doesn't indicate that he
was, but it was my opinion at that time and still is that he was <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After you had read that letter, meaning the letter of May 5, 1961,
which is Commission Exhibit 299, you felt that, or you had the reaction that,
he was becoming disenchanted with Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was later confirmed by subsequent letters in which
he expressly <span class="locked">stated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Disenchantment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There appears to be on some of the envelopes now in evidence
some stamps. They are in Russian but they may indicate that they are
stamps placed upon those envelopes by a censor, and we will now undertake to
investigate that circumstance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Would you like for me to tell you which ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you will give me the dates I will recite the exhibit numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It is June 26, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Commission Exhibit No. 300.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. August 21, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the envelope dated August 21?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you see if that contains a one-page letter; oh, yes,
August 21, that is Commission Exhibit No. 303.</p>

<p>You need not do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And September 10, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Commission Exhibit No. 305.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And I call the Commission's attention particularly to the
word stamped on the envelope "recommende" for whatever it means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate, Mr. Oswald, Marina's ability to
speak or understand English at the time that she and your brother returned
from Russia in June of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Her ability to understand was far less than her ability to
speak English words. I spoke to her on the telephone the night of June 13,
1962 from New York City, to my residence in Fort Worth, Tex., and her
statement to me at that time was, "Hello, Robert." I replied but no answer,
and Lee took the telephone over again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the month they lived in your home, were you better
able to form an opinion as to her ability to speak and understand English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe the best way to establish the degree of what she
understood in English at that time and her ability to speak the English
language would be very, very, very small, if anything at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to her facility in that regard&mdash;did her facility in that
regard become better as the months and years wore on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion which you overheard or with you,
respecting her undertaking to study, learn to speak, English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she most certainly wanted to learn to speak English at
the time, and she was staying at my home in Fort Worth, Tex., and prior to
their departure from Fort Worth, Tex., to Dallas, Tex., in the winter of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your brother's attitude with respect to her desires in
that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall him stating his desires in that respect either pro
or con.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no impressions on the subject either way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I might have an impression, pardon me, that he
wanted her particularly at the time we were staying, they were staying at my
home in Fort Worth, Tex., to learn English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was expressed in your presence during that period of time
by him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not in so many words, sir. It was perhaps implied, and he left
me with the impression that he wanted her to learn English at that time or as
soon as she possibly could, and I might add that on a number of occasions during
the visit at my home in Fort Worth, Tex., that my daughter Cathy, with her
childhood language in 1961, which would establish her age at 4 years old, would
talk to her and it appeared that she would gather more English from Cathy than
she would the adults in the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the State Department or any agency of the United States,
get in touch with you with respect to your supplying funds or the possibility of
your supplying funds to your brother while he was still in Russia for the purpose
of financing his return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any agency of the United States or any public body located
in New York City get in touch with you with respect to supplying him funds
for his transportation from New York City to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that the initial request or knowledge to you that you received
that funds were necessary, or would be needed for that purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the name of the agency? Was it the one that
you identified yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>In his letter of November 30, 1961, he makes a request for a football.</p>

<p>Did you send the football to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the letter of December 14, 1961, which is Commission Exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
No. 311, he makes a reference to the fact that he had not received any letter
with "certain" questions. Apparently questions that you had put to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The letter of July 14?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, this is December 14.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Commission Exhibit 311. It is two pages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that refresh your recollection as to some letter you had
written him prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you state what the letter was and whether it was in response
to an earlier letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it was not in response&mdash;it was a response to an earlier
letter from Lee. I did in an effort to determine whether or not all my <span class="locked">letters&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The last prior letter was the letter of November 30, 1961, Commission
Exhibit 308, and then immediately prior to that was the letter of November
1, 1961, Commission Exhibit 309.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In reference to the question regarding that letter of December 14,
1961, at which time he stated "I did not receive any letter with 'certain'
questions."</p>

<p>I did write him a letter at which time I recall raising two political type questions
to see whether or not he would <span class="locked">receive&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would respond?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To see whether he would respond, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To see whether or not he would receive the letter itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am sorry, I thought you said to receive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir; if my memory serves me correct in some earlier
letters he refers there to some Russian censors he felt like were censoring his
mail and my mail also and I wanted to find out in my own way whether this
was so or not.</p>

<p>I might say that was the only time I attempted to raise any type of political
questions in my response to any of his letters or any other letters that I sent
him, because I did want the letters to go through rather than be destroyed or
not received by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We can draw our own inference as to whether he received your
letter.</p>

<p>Was there any discussion of the subject after return to the United States,
that is, the subject whether he had received your letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my recollection, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion with your brother on the subject
of his undesirable discharge after he returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when was that? Was it more than one occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, only on one occasion did we discuss that matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that? Where was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately June 1962 at my home in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe just Lee and I were present in this one room which
was the living room of our home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said he wanted to go down the next day to the Marine
Corps office in Fort Worth, Tex., and discuss with them and perhaps find
out what action he needed to take to have this corrected to an honorable
discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My reply to him on that was that I thought that that was a good
idea and that he might raise the question at the Marine Corps office in Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Worth, Tex., if I could be of some assistance in writing the Marine Corps
office directly on behalf of him. I do not recall if he made this trip to the
Marine Corps office. I do not recall any further conversation in reference to his
dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn your attention now to the letter of May 22,
1962, shortly before he returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Commission Exhibit 318.</p>

<p>As I recall that letter, he refers to some things that you had said when he
departed for Russia. Do you find that portion of the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read it aloud, please, just that portion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. May I interrupt you at this point, Mr. Jenner?</p>

<p>Please, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Certainly, proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The two letters of November 8 and November 26 which we
should make copies of for the purposes of the record, if you will pull them out
of your file there I will&mdash;do you want to take the originals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That will be the best way of doing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Except that yours are already marked with the exhibit number.
I have no objection.</p>

<p>I will find out who I should see about making these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why do you not make them on the Xerox machine?</p>

<p>I had asked you to read that portion of the letter so we can place the matter
in context.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "I know what was said about me when I left the United States
as Mother sent me clippings from the newspapers. However, I realize it was
just the shock of the news which made you say all those things. However, I will
just remind you again not to make any statement or comments if you are
approached by the newspapers between now and the time we actually arrive in
the United States."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he referring then to things that were reported in the newspaper
clippings that you said or is he referring to something you said to him
before he departed for Russia, or is he referring to something you said in a
letter you may have written him when he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He is referring, sir, to the clippings of newspapers that mother
had sent him containing reportedly my statements to the newspapers at the
time we were advised on October 31, 1959 that Lee was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to make any comments to newspaper
reporters when it became known that he was about to return to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did those come to your brother's attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss them or he with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When the newspaper reporters contacted me prior to his arrival
in New York City, I did not divulge my knowledge of his departure as per
this letter of May 22, 1962, the approximate date he would be in the United
States. I did not give them any indication whatsoever at that time that he was
leaving the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever respond to that particular letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask a question here?</p>

<p>You indicated that your brother was disappointed when he arrived at Love
Airfield and the newspapermen were not there when he came back from Russia.</p>

<p>Did the newspapermen thereafter talk with your brother at your house or
elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They attempted to, sir. I say "they." It was, more specifically,
one newspaperman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did not succeed in getting an interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Reference is made in your brother's letter to you of November 17,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
1962, which is Commission Exhibit 320, to Thanksgiving dinner. Would you
obtain that exhibit, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What Thanksgiving, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1962, sir.</p>

<p>Was the Thanksgiving dinner held at your home on Thanksgiving Day,
November 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us all of the circumstances preceding, leading
up to and what occurred on that date and who attended the Thanksgiving
dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee and Marina and their small child had moved to Dallas,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where in Dallas, Tex.? Do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not have any address, sir. I had only a post office box,
Box 2915, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My older brother John had called me from San Antonio, Tex.,
prior to Thanksgiving 1962, indicating that he was going to be able to take a
<span class="locked">leave&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is some confusion respecting this Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Where John was stationed in the Air Force&mdash;he called me from
San Antonio stating that he would be able to take a leave during the period of
Thanksgiving of November 1962 and that they would travel from San Antonio,
Tex., to my home in Fort Worth, Tex. I wrote Lee and asked him would it
be possible for him to join us at that time with his family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you indicate in your letter that his brother John and wife
were to join you on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you indicate that anyone in addition, to wit, your mother,
was also to join you on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In reference to the letter dated November 17, 1962, from Lee
Harvey <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Commission Exhibit 320.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It replied to my letter: "In answer to your kind invitation for
Thanksgiving, we love to come and will be in Fort Worth Thanksgiving morning
and we shall come by bus and give you a ring on the phone from the bus station
(about 9:10). See you soon. Lee."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he come to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For that particular occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did he arrive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately nine to ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of Thanksgiving Day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he accompanied by anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina N. Oswald and the baby June Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did all of you have Thanksgiving dinner on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did both Lee and Marina attend that dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And John Pic and his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your children?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The children of Lee and Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The child. There was only one at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right, the child June. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The children of John and Marge Pic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your mother did not attend the dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you invited her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know, she was unaware of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any comment made that she was not present, about the fact
that she was not present at the dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said about what your brother Lee was doing by
way of employment in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was said, and by whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel like I had asked Lee what he was doing at that particular
time, and his reply to me was that he was working for a traffic outfit in Dallas,
the name of which I do not recall. However, he did state the name of the
firm. I do not recall the name of the firm. And that it was to him very interesting
work. He thought that he could perhaps learn this type of work and
progress in it quite ably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did he appear to you mentally and physically on this occasion
of the Thanksgiving dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Very fit physically and very alert mentally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Discussion on that day occurred between you and your half-brother,
John Pic, did it not, respecting your brother Lee's un-American beliefs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate that discussion between yourself&mdash;was it
confined to a discussion between yourself and John Pic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you raise the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were concerned about his un-American beliefs, were you
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was not concerned about them. I wanted to state to John,
since he had not been in contact with Lee when Lee was in Russia, or when
he was at my home in Fort Worth, that this conversation took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You state it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was John present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It was to John.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was he present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was not. I was about to say that this conversation
took place on our way from my house to the bus station to pick up Lee, Marina
and June the morning of Thanksgiving 1962. I do not recall the circumstances
preceding this particular point of why I brought it up other than I do recall
mentioning that the FBI had talked to Lee and apparently that everything was
all right because they were not proceeding to discuss with him at any length and
they were not holding him for any reason, so I assumed that everything was
all right in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Have you exhausted your present recollection of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did you know that the FBI had talked with Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee had told me and I was aware that they had called my house
and requested Lee to come down to their office in Fort Worth and talk with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles.</span> Did he report to you on that conversation at all? The details of
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A very small detail of it, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What details?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I asked him when I returned home from work that afternoon how
did it go. He said, "Just fine." He said they asked him at the last whether or
not he was an agent for the United States Government. His reply was "Don't
you know?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recited that yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. This was testified to yesterday. It is repetition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you at that time say to John that the FBI had&mdash;excuse me&mdash;had
assured you that Lee was all right and not dangerous to our country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say to John on that occasion or any other occasion that
he need not worry about Lee in connection with possible danger to our country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was on the same occasion on the trip to the bus station as
I have so indicated, that I had assumed, since they were not holding Lee or
questioning him to any frequency, because at that time they had only questioned
him to my knowledge one time, that everything as far as un-American
views that he expressed when he went to Russia, everything was cleared and
they had no reason to hold him or suspect him of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know about the Fair Play for Cuba incident in New
Orleans at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother Lee and Marina leave your home after Thanksgiving
dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to see your brother at any time from that
moment when he departed until sometime on the 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, may I interrupt you one more time?</p>

<p>In response to your question, Mr. Chairman, it is my best recollection, and I
may be wrong and stand to be corrected if I am wrong, that the Fair Play for
Cuba or the pro-Castro leaflets that he was handing out in New Orleans was in
the summer of 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think you may be right.</p>

<p>Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is correct. It had not taken place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It had not taken place in November of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. To the best of our knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the witness have any opportunity to respond to my last
question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You had finished your question and I interrupted you before
you could make another question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean the witness had responded to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No; I do not think he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read the pending question?</p>

<p>(The last question was read by the reporter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see Marina at any time subsequent to their departure
on Thanksgiving Day, November 1962 and November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you have any telephone conversations with either of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the interim period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there a number of those or were they infrequent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I recall only one, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately two or three weeks after Thanksgiving of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be sometime then in December of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you call him or did he call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recognized his voice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it day or night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was, I believe it was Sunday afternoon, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sunday afternoon. And what was the occasion of his making
that call as you recall it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That he was in town briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In Fort Worth, Tex., and that I asked would we see him; he
said no, they were visiting some friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "They" meaning he and Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, and that they would be leaving for Dallas very shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was a social call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have given the full of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my remembrance; yes, sir. It was very short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to talk to Marina over the telephone on
that particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he talk with any other member of your family on that
occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that telephone conversation, had you had any other
conversation with your brother Lee from the time on Thanksgiving Day, November
1962 to the time you saw him on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not see him on <span class="locked">November&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He did not see him on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He saw him on November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then my question is November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not had any conversation with him after November
1962, Thanksgiving Day, other than the one I have mentioned, up to the
time of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you make any attempts to get in touch with him in that
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only through the mail, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to come to that.</p>

<p>Did you have any correspondence with him in the sense of your dispatching
a letter or note or he dispatching one to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you retain the correspondence insofar as anything you
received from him is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And that has previously been furnished to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has previously been furnished and it is, I see, a postcard
which is dated as I recall&mdash;you give the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We are still referring to the period after November 1962,
Thanksgiving Day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, we are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>One postcard dated January 10, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is Commission Exhibit 324.</p>

<p>Did you receive any other correspondence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you have it there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is a letter dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. March 16, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is Commission Exhibit 322.</p>

<p>Did you receive any other correspondence from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you dispatch any to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they have any relation to either of the exhibits you have
now identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, neither Exhibit 322 nor Exhibit 324 was in response
to any communication that you had dispatched to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, sir, I was incorrect on that.</p>

<p>The letter of March 16, 1963 was in response to a letter I had written him
approximately the first week of March 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you retain a copy of the letter you sent him? And if you
made one, did you retain a copy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; no copy was made and I did not retain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state the contents of your letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was, briefly, sir, that we had moved to Malvern, Ark. I
informed him of my new address and advised him that I had placed my home
in Fort Worth, Tex., up for sale, and I had been given an opportunity by the
company for a better and higher position, and that I had taken this opportunity
and moved to Malvern, Ark. and requested, if possible, we would like to have
them visit us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When did you move to Malvern, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The fifth day of March 1963, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And how long were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To September 13, 1963, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And then you returned <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. Then I moved to Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Denton, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that at the time of the event, November 22, 1963, you were
residing in Malvern, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was residing in Denton, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I should have said Malvern, Ark., anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Let's see, you were then in Malvern, Ark., from March 1963, to
approximately September 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is where I misunderstood. I thought he said December.</p>

<p>All right, sir. I take it then at least from Thanksgiving Day, 1962, and the
23d day of November, 1963, you never had any discussions with Robert with
respect to his desire, if any, to return to Russia, with Lee rather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with him on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with him or he with you or
with Marina or she with you on her return to Russia, whether he desired it or
she did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During that period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did that discussion that you now have in mind take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At my home in June of 1962, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My wife Vada and Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With Marina I take it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And Marina was there.</p>

<p>Yes, sir; I was having a conversation or she was having something of a conversation
with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before you give the conversation, was there ever any other occasion
up to and including November 23, 1963 when you had a discussion with
your brother or with Marina respecting the return of either of them to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I only recall this one occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. State what was said, please, and by whom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was said by Marina Oswald in June of 1962 in very broken
English: "I never want to go to Russia again."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was said in the presence of your brother Lee, your
presence and your wife's presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I feel certain that all four of us were present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother say anything on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to that subject matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This took place in your home? How long after they had returned
from Russia did this conversation take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. What was that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say 1 or 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One or two weeks after they had returned from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is when they were staying with you after their return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time prior to November 23, 1962, were you aware or did
any incident arise or conversation take place indicating any desire on your
brother Lee's part to go to Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any other country than the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there any particular reason why you did not have some
contact with Lee during the period November, Thanksgiving 1962, and your
departure for Arkansas in March of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; none that I was aware of. I did write him on two or
three occasions asking him to advise me of his address in Dallas, Tex., so when
I had an opportunity either on business or otherwise passing through where I
could possibly stop and see him, if not Marina and the child.</p>

<p>His response to this was as it is stated in the letter of March 17, 1963, that
generally he was moving and it was not settled and he would always retain
the post office box in Dallas, Tex., where I might reach him through the mail
and that I would not be able to see him or his family when I came through town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did that surprise you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It did not at first, sir, because I realized he was not settled as
to a stable job and to an apartment. However, it did concern me later, and I
refer to my letter that I wrote him in March of 1963 which he replied to on
March 17 or March 16, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is Commission Exhibit 322.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That I would like to have an address other than a post office
box, and when again he did not furnish me this information, I did not respond
to his letter of March 17, 1963. The last time I wrote him was in September
1963 when I returned to Texas and our moving into Denton, Tex., advising him
of my new address, and still at that time requesting again an address where
they were staying at in Dallas so that I might contact him, since again we were
close together, approximately 30 miles away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he did not respond to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he never responded to that letter that I wrote him in
September other than on the day that I visited him at Dallas County Jail or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Dallas City Jail on November 23, 1963, he did say before I had an opportunity
to say anything to him, "Robert, you now are living in Denton, aren't you?"
And I said yes.</p>

<p>In other words, he had received my letter of September 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was elicited by Mr. Dulles' question, his failure to advise
you in due course eventually here as late as September 1963 of his location in
Dallas aroused some suspicions, doubts or a question in your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It did to this extent, that I thought <span class="locked">perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Keep in mind all this history also, Mr. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you testified about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That perhaps he was angry at us or did not want to have anything
to do with us. However, it was also my thinking on this that this would
be out of character for him because he normally would keep in contact with
me and let me have his address and so forth, even though he had furnished a
post office box at first and which I understood, but his failure to give me an
address <span class="locked">indicated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Despite your at least two requests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or three requests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Indicated to me that perhaps something of a different nature
was going on that I was not aware of, whether he was having trouble with
Marina and perhaps the baby, and they were not getting along and he did not
want me to become aware of this situation; this would be my only speculation
on that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did your wife have any contact with Marina over this period
we are discussing from Thanksgiving of 1962 to November 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever indicate to you that she made any effort to effect a
contact with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Did my wife?</p>

<p>No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the light, Mr. Oswald, of the fact that your brother, as you
testified, you thought looked up to you in his youth at least, in the light of his
departure for Russia, in the light of the correspondence that you had with him
in Russia about which you have testified, in the light of the conversations that
you had with him upon his return, did not the fact that you did not hear from
him for as long a period as from Thanksgiving Day of 1962 to well into the fall
of 1963 raise any question in your mind beyond that which you have now
testified about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That it might be something other than possible marital difficulties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Of course, I refer to the postcard of January 10, 1963, and the letter of March
17, 1963, which I would state other than the fact that he did not advise me of
his residence in Dallas, <span class="locked">Tex.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Despite the fact that you requested it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Right, that the infrequency of the mail at this time was going
back to prior to the time that he was in Russia, to the extent that he was not
writing frequently then when he was in the service and so forth, and then again
I thought that he was returning to this, because I was also not writing him as
frequently as we had while he was in Russia. And it is my opinion, sir, that
Lee felt that he had caused me enough difficulty, that he did not want to in
any way, even though I had offered my assistance after his return from Russia,
in any way that I possibly could, that he did not want to burden me in case he
was in any financial difficulty or any other difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>I am going to attempt to cover in general terms, Mr. Chairman, Representative
Ford's questions and see if I can shorten up the examination in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I have just a word with you for just a moment.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are acquainted at least by hearsay at the moment, are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
not, with respect to an alleged attack having been made by your brother upon
General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is that to which I wish to direct a question.</p>

<p>Did you have any knowledge or information of any kind or character at any
time prior to November 24, 1963, of that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No one had spoken to you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did it first come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In the newspaper. I believe this to be sometime in the latter
part of December 1963 or January 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was subsequent to your brother's death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had no information direct or indirect of any kind or
character, scuttlebutt, hearsay or otherwise, up to that moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know of any acts of violence that your brother had
carried out or had contemplated or attempted during his life other than school
boy antics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not. I have never known him to attempt or indicate
to attempt to carry out any type of violence other than a <span class="locked">schoolboy&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he given to tantrums?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he ever seem to you to be a man who repressed himself, that
he was boiling inside and that there were a great many emotions that he had
that he was holding in? Did you get that impression from your knowledge of
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. I would say that Lee's character was that he
was more of a listener than a talker, not to the extent of being an introvert. I
do not believe he was an introvert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to ask you that question. There have been people
who have been interviewed, teachers and others, a good many of them as a
matter of fact, who have described your brother as an introvert. Your mother
used the expression that he was a loner in a statement that she made to the
authorities in New York City, and I think on this record.</p>

<p>Was he in your opinion, gathered from your actual experience with him during
his lifetime, a loner, that is, a person who would tend to prefer to be by himself
and not seek out friends, not necessarily repulse friends but not affirmatively
seek them out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say yes and no, sir, to that question if I may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Would you expand then and explain your answer yes and no?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel like in the late 1940s to about the time of my departure
to the service in July of 1952, that he did seek out friends, and that he did have
friends. However, after my release from the service in 1955, I do believe that
he had become more grown to himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is during the interim he had become, while you were away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You noticed a change in him when you returned from the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that what you mean to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, proceed and describe that to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Still my contact with him was limited, but he did appear to be
drawn within himself more than he had been prior, and I do not know of any
friends that he had at that particular time.</p>

<p>One factor of course would be that he had moved quite frequently or a number
of times during this period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Apart from the reason, for the moment, I seek to draw from you
your personal reaction as to whether he had become more retiring and that you
had actually noticed that difference in him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, to me, sir, he had become or appeared to become more
drawn into himself to the extent that I noticed that he wanted to read more,
and of course when he wanted to read he wanted to be by himself. However,
to me personally at that time when we were together, if he did not wish to read,
he seemed and appeared to be as he was prior to 1952, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that state of mind or his action, did you notice that that
persisted when he returned from Russia?</p>

<p>Was he still of that retiring nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was not. I felt that he was more of a gregarious type
person that wanted to mix with people and wanted to talk to people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After he left your home and took residence with your mother and
thereafter in various places in Fort Worth, did he seek you out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. He called me on a number of occasions at my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he come by your home and visit you voluntarily without
invitation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall of any time, sir. I usually was talking to him
on the telephone quite frequently during the period that he had moved out of
my mother's apartment into their own duplex, to the extent that I always told
him that if he would like to come out any time just to give me a ring and I would
gladly pick them up and bring them out to the house and return them to their
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There has been some testimony here before the Commission to
the general effect that in the latter period he broke pretty much away with some
of the Russian group of friends in Dallas that Marina had developed or
liked to be with, and that is because she could talk Russian. Did you see anything
of that, and can you throw any further light on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. I was aware or had become aware of this
group or some other group of the Russian-speaking population in Dallas, and I
was aware of Mr. Gregory in Fort Worth, Tex., who had come to my house
before Lee and Marina had moved out, to speak in the Russian language to
Marina and to Lee. I was not aware that&mdash;I was aware that he was talking with
and becoming acquainted with this group of persons, and I was not aware of the
fact that he was withdrawing from this group of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know anything about his relations with a certain man
named De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Dulles, who is the Chairman of the session today, has
asked Mr. Oswald if he knows or has heard of a man by the name of De
Mohrenschildt. Robert Oswald's answer I believe is reflected on the record that
he did not know Mr. De Mohrenschildt. I have stated off the record to Mr.
Dulles and to Mr. Jenner that I know George De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>I became acquainted with George De Mohrenschildt in this manner. Shortly
after the law was passed in Texas that we could have women <span class="locked">jurors&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you fix that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No, I cannot, but it has been within the last five years. I
would say. But shortly after the law was passed that we could have women
jurors sitting in our courts, my wife happened to be on a jury in Dallas, Texas,
in one of our district courts. Sitting on that same jury with my wife, Sally
McKenzie was a man by the name of George De Mohrenschildt. As a result of
her jury experience in the trial of this case, in which he was a juror, I met
George De Mohrenschildt. I have since come to know him briefly, and in no way
intimately.</p>

<p>George De Mohrenschildt at one time was married to a lady from Pennsylvania
by the name of Wynne Sharples. They were subsequently divorced in Dallas.
Wynne Sharples is an M.D. by profession. She comes from a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
Pennsylvania family, and her father has been engaged in the oil business under
the name of Sharples Oil Company.</p>

<p>Wynne Sharples, following her divorce from George De Mohrenschildt, remarried
and married another M.D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her married name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I do not recall her married name, but I do believe that she and
her then husband, and I presume her present husband, the doctor that she
married, were engaged in medical research at some hospital in Philadelphia or
Baltimore, looking to the cause and a cure of a children's ailment of a very
serious nature, and I believe it was connected with some blood type ailment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Leukemia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No, it was not leukemia. There was an article on Wynne
Sharples in one of the magazine supplements of either the Dallas Times-Herald
or the Dallas Morning News, within the past five years.</p>

<p>George De Mohrenschildt has subsequently remarried, and some time within
the past two years there was an article on George De Mohrenschildt in one of the
Dallas daily newspapers, telling of a trip that he and his new bride were going
to take through Mexico and Central America walking. In other words, they
were going to walk from Dallas or the Mexican-United States border through
Mexico and through Central America. It is my understanding that such a trip
was taken, and that George De Mohrenschildt has since that time returned to
Dallas, Tex. In fact, I have seen him in Dallas, Tex., within the past 7 months.</p>

<p>I do not know of any relationship between George De Mohrenschildt and
Marina Oswald or Lee Harvey Oswald, nor have I ever heard of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe George De Mohrenschildt physically, his
physical appearance, the one you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The man that I know is a large man, approximately six foot
one to three inches. He would probably weigh 205 to maybe 215 pounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He appears to be between 45 and 50 or 51 or 52. He has got
a dark complexion, and I would say a typically foreign expression or foreign
look to him, from the standpoint of being either a Russian or of the Slavic races.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever spoken with him, to give us your impression of
whether he has a foreign inflection in his speech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He does have a foreign inflection in his speech, and I have
heard, I do not know this to be true, but I have heard that Mr. De Mohrenschildt
has quite a way with the ladies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, thanks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, I have asked you about the Nixon and General
Walker incidents. Did you at any time prior to November 23, 1963, have drawn
to your attention any incident of any kind or character of action on the part
of your brother Lee similar to those which have been raised as to General
Walker and Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have seen pictures of, and you have heard about, the rifle
which was allegedly employed by the assassin of President Kennedy in that
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have seen pictures of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you at any time prior to November 23, 1963, ever see the
rifle which is alleged to have been employed in the assassination of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see at your home or any place a rifle of that character
in the possession of your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see any rifle of that character in or about any
premises that he might or was occupying or that Marina was occupying?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not. I might further state I never knew him to
own but one firearm in his entire life, and that was a .22 caliber rifle that he
purchased from New Orleans, La., and on my visit to New Orleans, La., in
1955 on my discharge from the service, I purchased this from Lee for a
total of $10. He had given approximately $16 for the rifle. It would not fire.
And I gave him $10 for it, and took it back to Fort Worth and worked on it
and put it into working condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion, did any discussion take place between
you and Lee, or in your presence, other than that which you have testified
heretofore up to this moment, of his use of a firearm, be it a pistol or a rifle, during
the period from June 1962 to, and including, the 23d of November, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing of that character occurred between you or in your
presence and his presence during all of that period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir. I might say what they were saying at
my home in Fort Worth, Tex., on Davenport Street during the first week, Lee
and I were discussing hunting and so forth out at my in-laws' farm, I did produce
at that time all weapons in my possession in front of Marina and Lee.
They made Marina Oswald nervous, and shortly after looking at my weapons,
I returned them to their proper place, and that was the only time that I have
ever seen him handle a weapon from the time that he returned from Russia in
1962 until the reports of present-day activities along that line that he handled
a weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just to nail down this subject, I take it then that at no time
from the time of his return in June of 1962 to the United States to and including
November 23, 1962, did you ever see him in the possession of a firearm of
any kind or character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. If I may, sir, referring to the hunting trip
that we did take at the farm in June of <span class="locked">1962&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that to which you have already testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct, at no time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had that in mind when you answered my question in
the negative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was excluding your prior testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Apart from newspaper photographs, have you ever to your knowledge
seen Jack Ruby on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or a person said to be Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Use his full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Jack Rubenstein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever been in any establishment allegedly operated by
him or in which he has an interest, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Would you mind, sir, giving me the names of those establishments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will do that from other papers later on, but to your present
knowledge, without refreshing or stimulating your recollection, could you give
me an answer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have not, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now would you go on and ask him, or would you prefer <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you mind waiting? I am just taking care of Representative
Ford's questions at the moment.</p>

<p>Your mother testified that an FBI agent had shown her a picture of some
man on the evening of Saturday, November 23, 1963. She testified further
that later, after your brother had been killed, she saw a picture of Jack Ruby
or Jack Rubenstein alias Jack Ruby in the newspaper, and that she exclaimed
in your presence that Ruby was the man whose picture had been shown to
her on a Saturday night, November 23, 1963, by an agent of the FBI. Does
that refresh your recollection?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please testify or tell us of where that took place,
who was present and what the circumstances were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That took place at the Inn of the Six Flags in Arlington, Tex.,
during the week of November 25, 1963, in the presence I believe of two or
more Secret Service agents, and perhaps an Arlington police officer in the rooms
that were assigned at the Inn of the Six Flags, and I feel like at least one
of the Secret Service agents that was <span class="locked">present&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir, you used the expression "and I feel like". Do
you mean you are speculating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, is that a better expression, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead, and then I will ask you on what basis you base
that belief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir. I believe that the Secret Service agents, at least
one of them was Mr. Mike Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your best recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what you mean by believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I testify it was either two or three Secret Service agents present,
and my best recollection, another Secret Service agent would be Mr. Charles I.
Kunkel, and if my recollection serves me correctly, there was an Arlington
police officer at the time. It would be either Mr. Bob Parsons or Mr. Jeff Gan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were the persons present on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what occurred and what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, to my best recollection, mother was in another room
and she had received a copy of a newspaper which I cannot identify, that
reportedly had a picture of Mr. Rubenstein or Mr. Jack Ruby, and mother
exclaimed to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she come into the room in which you gentlemen were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she had the newspaper in her possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she walked among you and said something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she exhibit anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A picture that I could recognize as a picture now of a man
known as Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was a picture in the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And she stated to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the presence of the others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that on Saturday night, November 23, 1963, that two
FBI agents had gone to the Executive Inn in Dallas, to the rooms where mother
and Marina and Baby June Lee Oswald were staying, and that at this particular
time Marina was taking a bath or a shower, mother had just completed
hers, she was in a robe, she did not open the door fully, that one of the FBI
agents produced a picture that she stated was Mr. Jack Ruby, and that was
the text of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You did not see the picture that was shown by the Secret
Service man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The FBI man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The FBI man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not. I was not there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Assuming it was shown, it was not exhibited to you. Your
mother stated that a picture of Mr. Jack Ruby had been exhibited to her by
an FBI man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That a picture that an FBI <span class="locked">man&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the Saturday night, November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that the FBI man exhibited a picture, and mother
said that she recognized from the newspaper to be Mr. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any of the gentlemen present say anything when your
mother made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe they did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Give us your best recollection of what was said,
and if you can identify the person, do so, but in any event tell us what was said,
if you can identify them only by stating he was a police officer or a Secret
Service man or an FBI agent, then do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe Mr. Mike Howard of the United States Secret Service
looked at the picture in the newspaper and said something to mother in the line
or in the nature of "Are you sure" and so forth like that. It was very brief,
and she was saying that she was positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She responded that she was certain of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that she was certain that the photograph shown to her
on Saturday night, November 23, 1963, was the man in the picture being identified
as Mr. Jack Ruby, the killer of my brother, Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she say anything about what the officer who had shown her
this photograph had said to her, or explained why he was showing that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, she did indicate that they wanted to show it to
Marina for identification, and mother explained to him that she was in the
shower and was fixing to go to bed, and they were very tired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now would you give us please your opinion and judgment as to
the stability of your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Prior to November 22, 1963&mdash;&mdash;correction, prior to November 24,
1963, I believed her to be a stable average person. However, during the week of
November 24, including the date of November 24, 1963, through Friday of that
week, which was November 29, 1963, due to the happenings and the events that
had ensued from the November 22d afternoon through Sunday of November 23d,
it is my opinion that at first that her reactions were quite normal, and to be
expected.</p>

<p>However, it is my opinion during the latter part of that week, from approximately
Wednesday, November 27, 1963, that her reactions to other matters
related to the events of November 22 and November 24, 1963, were abnormal
reactions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did those normal or abnormal reactions continue to the best of
your knowledge thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Since I have not seen her, sir, since Friday November 29, 1963,
I have talked with her on telephone calls only, I have no opinion on that at
this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether continued or not continued?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have testified that you thought you had an influence on
Lee's joining the Marines. That is an influence of an example rather than a
direct influence, that is any direct contact by you suggesting that if he entered
the service he should enter the Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That would be correct, sir. It would be as an example.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned a Mr. Gregory having visited at your home. Will
you identify him, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe his given name, sir, is Mr. Peter Gregory, but I am
confused a little bit about his son. His son's name is Paul Gregory, or vice
versa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is Peter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you. Mr. Peter Gregory came to my residence in Fort
Worth, Tex. on 7313 Davenport Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Approximately when, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Two occasions, the first occasion being approximately the last
week in June, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He had come over to see Lee and meet Marina and talk with
them in his native Russian language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he accompanied by anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not on this first occasion, sir, if my memory serves me correctly.
I believe he was by himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said in your presence that you understood, having
in mind that he spoke Russian at least in part of that occasion, as to how he
became aware that Lee and Marina were residing with you temporarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were expecting Mr. Gregory to come by that night. The
preceding 2 or 3 days, I understood from Lee, that when he inquired at
one of the bureaus of the Texas employment agencies in Fort Worth, that someone
that he had talked to about a job had set up an appointment with Lee to go
see Mr. Gregory, since Lee could speak Russian and write the Russian language,
they thought perhaps Mr. Gregory might know of some contact that he could place
Lee with, where Lee might obtain a job speaking and writing the Russian language.
I understood from <span class="locked">Lee&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the result of discussions in your presence in your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By Lee and Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By Lee to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. And I understood <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, if you could, if it is the result of Lee having told you,
would you please state it in those terms rather than that you understood,
because your understanding may be based on hearsay that is not the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Lee in our conversation told me that he went to Mr. Gregory's
office on the first occasion to meet Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that would be before this last week in June when Mr. Gregory
visited your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is Mr. Gregory's profession, do you happen to know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was a consultant geologist. On this first occasion that Lee
spent 1 or 2 hours talking with Mr. Gregory, and at the end of this occasion, Mr.
Gregory gave Lee a letter to the effect, which I did <span class="locked">read&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother Lee exhibit this letter to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you seen the letter from the time that you read it to the
present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as far as you know the letter doesn't exist. You don't know
whether it exists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please recite the content of it as you now recall it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That it stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was competent to speak
and write the Russian language fluently. That is my general remembrance of
this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it signed? Did it have a signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it on a letterhead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was Mr. Gregory a Russian by origin as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was he a naturalized American, or don't you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This I do not know, sir. But during this conversation, he told
me about Mr. Gregory to the extent that he had come from Russia <span class="locked">approximately&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This is your brother now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, talking to me. Approximately 40 years prior to that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So he had been in this country for approximately 40 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not long after that conversation in which your brother Lee
reported these things to you that Mr. Gregory visited at your home the last
week in June of 1962, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, approximately the last week in June 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did your brother tell you where he had gotten to know Mr.
Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Through the lady at the Texas employment agency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had gone to the Texas employment agency and had an interview
with that lady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In charge of the agency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One of the personnel working within the agency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother say to you that she had suggested Mr. Gregory
as a possible source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With regard to employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That she had volunteered to call Mr. Gregory on his behalf to
set up an appointment where Lee could go by and see him and talk with him in
relation to employment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother indicate that that was his first acquaintance or
knowledge of the fact that a person named Peter Gregory existed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he said that to you affirmatively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the course of that conversation, did your brother report to
you any recommendations by the lady in charge of the agency with respect to his
contacting any other persons who were of Russian derivation or who could or
might speak Russian and be of possible assistance to your brother in obtaining
employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The conversation was confined to a Mr. Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you now given us all you can recall as to that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. Gregory visited your home the last week in June or at
least approximately then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He came alone to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was a visit, intended as a visit with Lee and Marina
primarily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were present when he came to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he exhibit any acquaintance, prior acquaintance with Lee or
with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He certainly recognized Lee. He did not recognize Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he introduced to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is your impression that he was not acquainted with her
prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or she with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question here. Do you know of any other
close friends of Lee's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At that time, sir, I was not aware of any others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Fords you met later, I believe, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And are they Russian or is one of them Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. His wife is originally from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you discover that, Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That Mrs. Ford was Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe Marina told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Representative Ford has asked that that subject be inquired
into also, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Won't you pursue it then if you wish, in whatever way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate to us to the best of your recollection the
names of Lee's friends or associates from his return to this country in June 1962
up to and including November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only ones I was aware of, sir, other than members of the
family, was Mr. Peter Gregory and his son, Paul Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I stop you at that moment. You say his son Paul Gregory.
Did you come to meet Paul Gregory as well as Peter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On some occasion subsequent to this last week in June of '62?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known that there was a Paul Gregory at the time Peter
Gregory visited your home in June of '62?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. He might possibly have mentioned his son at that time,
but I do not recall that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't have any specific recollection of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you meet Paul Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 2 or 3 days later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Under what circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Peter Gregory and Mr. Paul Gregory both came to the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is the second occasion of Mr. Gregory being in your
home, to which you have already alluded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the purpose of their visit at your house on that
occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To meet with Lee and Marina again, and to the best of my
remembrance, for his son, Paul Gregory, who was attending either the University
of Oklahoma or Oklahoma University, or Oklahoma State University, at which
he was studying the Russian language.</p>

<p>And I believe at this time he stated he was a junior at the university, and
that he wanted to be around others who spoke the Russian language, besides
his father, to improve his language, or his knowledge of the Russian language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that stated in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In this case, you now identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By Paul Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he attempt to converse, or converse with Lee, and/or with
Marina in Russian on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He did with both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on both occasions did Peter Gregory confer or talk with
Lee and Marina or either of them or both of them in Russian?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you forewarned or did you have notice that the Gregorys,
Paul and Peter, were to visit you on the second occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall any conversation you had with your brother in
advance of that visit, or with Marina on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are those the only two occasions that you ever saw or talked
with Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When subsequent to the second visit to your home, the first time
subsequent thereto, did you see or speak with Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I spoke again with Mr. Peter Gregory on Sunday morning,
November 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So it was an occasion subsequent to the death of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Howard Johnson's Restaurant on the turnpike between Fort
Worth and Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was to meet Mr. Gregory and two Secret Service agents at
that establishment, to proceed with them from there to the Executive Inn at
Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who had arranged that rendezvous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By mutual consent between myself and the Secret Service agent,
Mike Howard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Howard suggested it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He suggested this as a point of rendezvous on our way to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I believe this is described in your diary, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see or speak with Peter Gregory&mdash;have you seen or
spoken with Peter Gregory at any time subsequent to this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, first&mdash;when was that?
Is it recorded in your diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not believe it is in my diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when did that meeting take place? The one you now have
in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On three or four occasions during the week of November 25,
1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what city or town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Inn of the Six Flags, in Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was he visiting there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he was there voluntarily to act as an interpreter between
the United States Secret Service and Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Subsequent to that time, have you seen or spoken with Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, you were seeking to report to us the friends and acquaintances of your
brother and your sister-in-law subsequent to their return to the United States
in June of 1962. Now, who next in addition to Paul and Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were the Fords friends of your brother Lee and your sister-in-law
Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you became acquainted with them, when for the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Last Tuesday, a week ago this past Tuesday, on February 11,
1964.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were unacquainted with either of them prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have already testified about the Paines. And you can
recall none other&mdash;no other persons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Friend or acquaintance of either Marina or of your brother Lee
Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Other than the ones I have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Plus, of course, the Paines, whom you have already discussed,
and others you may have discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any knowledge of your brother Lee's defection or
alleged defection other than that which you read in the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And other&mdash;other than there might be a reference to that subject
in the correspondence you have produced for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any possible reason to believe that your brother Lee
Harvey Oswald knew Jack Ruby, or Jack Rubinstein, alias Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, are you asking for my opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am asking if you have any knowledge first&mdash;anything upon
which you can base an opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he did or might have had an acquaintance with Jack Ruby,
or Jack Rubinstein?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will ask you the same question as to Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. With regard to Jack Ruby, you hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>Do you have anything else in your mind about that that you wanted to add
or could add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I just misinterpreted his question as to whether or not he wanted
my opinion, rather than any facts that I might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, let's ask for your opinion now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we will go to your opinion.</p>

<p>Do you have an opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Based on the newspaper articles that appeared during the week
of November 25, 1963, at which time two reported employees of Mr. Jack Ruby,
a man and a woman, stated to newspaper reporters that they had seen Lee
Harvey Oswald in Mr. Ruby's establishment, known as the Carousel Club, and
also on one occasion either or both of these reported witnesses stated that they
had seen Mr. Ruby speaking to Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is on the basis of that newspaper report and only that
that you voice this opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>I might further elaborate on my opinion that at various times through various
magazine articles and television programs, indicating the route taken supposedly
by my brother Lee from the place of his boarding house, or apartment, and
prior to his capture, was in a direct or approximately a direct line to Mr. Ruby's
apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with the decision which your sister-in-law,
Marina, reached not to reside with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I most certainly am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you take part in that decision, or were you present
during the course of any event that resulted in her ultimate decision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say that that decision, sir, was 90 percent my decision,
and only 10 percent Marina N. Oswald's decision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, as to that event, would you please tell us the course it took, your participation
in it, where it occurred, and as much as you now recall about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This took place at the <span class="locked">Inn&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before you answer&mdash;it is not recorded in your diary, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. The diary would be the best evidence of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In order that I don't try to examine over 20 <span class="locked">pages&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have just read the diary, and I do not recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I don't, either. I don't believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This occurred at the Inn of the Six Flags in Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On Thursday morning, November 28, 1963, at which time I
talked to Mrs. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In whose presence, if anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If memory serves me correct, sir, in the presence of Mr. Jim
Martin, and perhaps one Secret Service agent that I cannot recall vividly enough
to identify by name. That Mr. Martin&mdash;if I may back up, sir. We did have a
Secret Service agent there. I do recall he was Mr. Gopadze, who was acting
as an interpreter. And I do believe that Mr. Gopadze acted as an interpreter
at the time when we discussed with Marina the possibility of her moving to
Mr. Jim Martin's home in Dallas, Tex., as a permanent guest or for as long
as she wished to with her children, and I believe at this time she asked my
opinion of this, whether or not I thought this was the thing to do, and my
advice to her was that it was, and that she was going to abide by my decision
that this was the thing to do at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This discussion occurred in the presence of these people you
have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Included in that discussion, was the alternative of her residing
with your mother discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not, because I did not look to that as an
alternative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether Marina&mdash;had there been any discussion
prior thereto, to your knowledge, of any possibility or suggestion by anyone
that Marina undertake residence with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir, was there any discussion between
me and Marina or myself and my mother that Marina was going to reside in
her place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a possibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir. I <span class="locked">might&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether the discussion was directly with you or not, was the
subject of the possibility&mdash;it is always possible&mdash;of Marina residing with your
mother&mdash;was it raised during this period of time? Did you know of anybody
ever suggesting it, or it being considered&mdash;apart from whether there was
discussion with you directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, to my knowledge I was not aware of any situation such
as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I forgot now.</p>

<p>Did you say Marina was present during the course of this discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she say anything on the subject through the interpreter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir, go to the preceding day of Thursday, November
28, 1963, to Wednesday, November 27, 1963, at which time I was advised by
Secret Service agent Mike Howard of the offer of Mr. Jim Martin to take
Marina and the children into the family, into his family, and raise them as
he would his own members of the family. I did not discuss at first with Marina
this offer. I did discuss with Mr. Jim Martin, prior to discussing with Marina
N. Oswald, this possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This possibility being what possibility?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of Marina accepting this offer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of Mr. Martin's, that is correct.</p>

<p>After my discussion with Mr. Martin on this <span class="locked">question&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that discussion, were any alternatives discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, there was not. It was a discussion only about Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
Martin's offer to her with me in the presence of two Secret Service agents at
lunch on that day, Wednesday, November 27, 1963. At the end of that discussion.
I considered in my own mind for a number of hours, perhaps three
or four hours, at which time I spoke to Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Inn of the Six Flags, in a motel room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anybody else present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They were present in the room, but we were in a separate room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They didn't take part in the discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>At which time I pointed out Mr. Martin to Marina Oswald, and related to her
as best I could at that time his offer to take Marina into his home, and the
children into his home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me interrupt you.</p>

<p>You say you pointed out Mr. Martin to your sister-in-law, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it&mdash;am I correct from that that she had not theretofore
become acquainted with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I believe she had, but at that time she had seen so
many people come in and out of there, that she did not remember which man
was Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>And, at this time, I did point out Mr. Martin, so that she would know him from
then on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any question raised about her residing at the home of a
person who was a complete stranger to her? And about whom you knew little
or nothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At this time I was considering this, and I believe this was
my attempt to have Marina consider this, of moving into a home with a complete
strange family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you were raising a question in your own mind
on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Up to that time of Mr. Martin's offer, not recalling anybody that I stated
it to&mdash;I assumed it my full responsibility to have Marina and her children move
into my home in Denton, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you suggested that to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or to anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had the suggestion been made to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, it had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was going back to the Paines in the picture at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To some extent, and that was excluded entirely by me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. For my observations of Mr. and Mrs. Paine at the Dallas police
office, as previously testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The antipathy to them that arose, or that you had when you
met Mr. Paine, and Mrs. Paine that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina say anything to you on the subject, of her desire
or possibility of her residing&mdash;returning to reside with the Paines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did she say on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That she thought she could go back up to Mr. and Mrs. Paine
and live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate that that would be entirely acceptable to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even desirable to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was your response to that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I indicated to her that I thought that that was not the thing
to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say that to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Affirmatively?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did she say in response to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, to the best of my memory she wanted to know why
I did not want her to return with her children to Mr. and Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a normal response.</p>

<p>What did you say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As best I could I indicated to her I didn't think they were the
proper or correct people for her to be associated with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that is a term of conclusion, Mr. Oswald. Would you
please tell us&mdash;were you more specific than that, or just say, "I don't think
they are the proper people"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. It is very difficult.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Try and reconstruct this conversation as best you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Jenner, he is trying his best to reconstruct the conversation,
and I think he has testified to the best of his recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are you tired at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I am not tired. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Let me ask you one question, if I may.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could he answer the question I have just put to him first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I, sir, in my own way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you object to the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No, I don't object to it, Mr. Dulles. I don't think that Robert
being a layman knows what a conclusion is insofar as the way the question
was framed or insofar as the way it was responded to. And I think he is
trying to answer your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't mean to suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>But the witness, as always&mdash;this is not criticism of this witness&mdash;they do
tend to speak in terms of conclusions.</p>

<p>I am seeking as best you are able to do to reconstruct this event and recite
what occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you restate the question, or rephrase it, whichever you
wish to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Marina indicated to you her desire to return to the Paines
and live with the Paines, and you responded as you have now testified, that
you thought that that would be unwise, and they were not the kind of people with
whom she should reside, would you please call on your recollection so as to
state, to the extent that you can, exactly what you said to her in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My recollection of that, sir&mdash;I stated to her, because of her
limited knowledge of English, that no&mdash;perhaps with some hand signals accompanying
my "no" that this was not the thing to do. And I perhaps pointed
to myself and indicated let me help her on this line&mdash;something of that nature,
sir.</p>

<p>That is the best I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you indicate to her by sign or by expression or statement
that you were suspicious of the Paines or that your reaction of that&mdash;was that
Saturday night, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, this was a Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wednesday night&mdash;had led you to have some reservations about
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I perhaps attempted to give her some more indication
on that. But due to the difficulty at that time of the language barrier, and
her limited English, and she, I believe, was agreeable in accepting my explanation,
no matter how brief it was&mdash;because, at this time, she was certainly
looking to me for advice in trying to follow my wishes as best as I could get
them over to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I just add for the record that the Commission realizes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
that Mr. and Mrs. Paine were separated or were living separately, and it was
probably going back to Mrs. Paine, although I understand Mr. Paine from time
to time would visit there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is my understanding, too, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that the understanding at the time you gave Marina
this advice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know whether Mr. Paine stayed there from time to time,
or he just visited his wife? I understand they are separated, and not divorced.
Isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is my understanding, also.</p>

<p>And in answer to your question, sir, I became aware of this on Saturday
night, November 23, 1963, at the Dallas police office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Aware of the separation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. As the Paines were about to depart with Marina and
the children and my mother. And the statement was made by Mr. Paine that
he would&mdash;I believe this to be my best recollection&mdash;that he would take them
out there and return to his apartment, at which time the looks on both my
mother's and myself's faces asked the question to Mrs. Paine, without saying
anything, and she said, "Well, it is a difficult situation, I will explain it on the
way."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that increased your antipathy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the decision was made, as you have related then, that
Marina would reside with the Martins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not on Wednesday night, sir.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the ensuing night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The following day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have told us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you had occasion to observe, did you not, the treatment
of FBI agents of your mother, at least in your presence? Their attitude
towards her and their treatment of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I do not recall any FBI agents in the presence of my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir&mdash;I believe you have reference to the United States
Secret Service agents there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. I was going to ask you that. But Representative Ford
has a question which he has limited, however, to the FBI, so I did want to cover
that.</p>

<p>You have no basis for an opinion, then, as to the treatment of your mother,
Marguerite, accorded to her by the&mdash;by FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You might have an opinion, but you have no&mdash;well, I will withdraw
that.</p>

<p>Now, I ask you, likewise, with respect to the Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was some friction with one agent and my mother, whom
she seemed to resent very harshly, any time this agent spoke to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You used the word "harshly." Does that include "unjustly"
in your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you share the opinion that the Secret Service agent you
have in mind was treating her harshly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I would not be of that opinion. And the Secret Service
agent in question here is Mr. Charlie Kunkel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this period, did you have a good impression of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having in mind all of the circumstances, and the stresses, and
his duties, do you have an opinion as to whether he accorded her normal and
expected courtesy and proper treatment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only on one occasion I might have a hesitation to give a positive
answer to that, sir. This occurred at the Inn of the Six Flags, in Arlington,
Texas. As Mr. Kunkel was going out the front door one day&mdash;I do not recall
the day&mdash;I would say this would be approximately Wednesday, November 27,
1963&mdash;there was a brief exchange at the doorway between Mr. Kunkel and my
mother, of which I am attempting to recall, at which time my mother stated to
him to the best of my remembrance, that "Please, sir, don't say anything to me
at all."</p>

<p>And Mr. Kunkel's reply was&mdash;and he was irritated&mdash;that he would not unless
he had to, and for her not to please say anything to him.</p>

<p>And that was the end of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the only harshness, if you would call it harshness, that
you observed occurring between any Secret Service agent and your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother has made an assertion before the Commission that
she believes that the FBI should have interviewed her, and she asserts that the
FBI did not interview her.</p>

<p>Do you have any information on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Are we referring to the period of the week of November 25, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have your question again, please?</p>

<p>(The reporter read the pending question.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During the week of November 25, 1963, my mother, Mrs. Marguerite
C. Oswald, was not interviewed by FBI agents.</p>

<p>I might add nor myself by the FBI agents.</p>

<p>And the only person out there, to my knowledge, that was interviewed by the
FBI agents was Mrs. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You had been interviewed, though, at a previous time by FBI
agents, had you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think that is indicated in your diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will touch on that subject in due course.</p>

<p>But Representative Boggs' area of questioning is confined to your mother.
Do you have any&mdash;do you know why the FBI did not interview your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The FBI did not arrive at the Inn of the Six Flags in Arlington,
Texas, until, to the best of my memory, Wednesday, November 27, 1963. There
is a possibility this might have been Tuesday, November 26th. But I do believe
it was Wednesday.</p>

<p>And their purpose of coming out there at that time, as stated to me by a
United States Secret Service man, Mike Howard, was to interview Marina N.
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did they do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did they interview your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they interview you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, they did not.</p>

<p>If I may, sir&mdash;in reply to your question whether or not they interviewed
Mrs. Marina N. Oswald at that time, they attempted to interview her at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an interpreter present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, there was. It was Mr. Lee Gopadze of the United
States Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you emphasize the word "attempt". Would you describe
the circumstances and what occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When the FBI agents arrived there&mdash;I can identify one of them
as a Mr. Brown, even though I know there are two or three Mr. Browns that I
have met in the FBI&mdash;I do not know his initials&mdash;the other man I cannot remember
his name. When the two agents and Mr. Gopadze came in, Marina
immediately identified or recognized one of the agents who she had talked to
before, and it is my understanding now, at the Paines' home in Irving, Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is my understanding some time in the early part of 1963, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did Marina state that, or did someone state that in your
presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This came to my knowledge, sir, after the departure of the FBI
agents on this particular day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Through what source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, through, to the best of my memory&mdash;through Mr.
Lee Gopadze, who acted as an interpreter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina present when you were afforded that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe she was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she have an aversion to being interviewed by the FBI
agent on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she expressed that aversion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the reason given in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That she did <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it&mdash;yes or no?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By whom; Mr. Gopadze, by interpretation, interpreting Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There, again, sir, this was knowledge given to me after their
departure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes&mdash;but through what source did you obtain it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Through Mr. Gopadze, in the presence of Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>And other Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did he say as to her aversion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That Marina had recognized this one FBI agent as a man
who had come to the Paines' home in Irving, Texas, and perhaps at another
location where they might have lived in Dallas, or the surrounding territory,
and had questioned Lee on these occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In or outside of the home. I do not know whether it took place
on the inside&mdash;but within the immediate grounds of the home, at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And was this early in 1963? Prior, anyway, to November 22,
1963, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct. And that this particular one agent&mdash;not
the Mr. Brown I have referred to, but the other gentleman that I do not
recall his name&mdash;she had an aversion to speaking to him because she was of
the opinion that he had harassed Lee in his interviews, and my observation of
this at this time, at this particular interview, was attempting to start&mdash;I
would say this was certainly so. His manner was very harsh, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Harsh towards Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it most certainly was. And by the tone of conversation
by Marina to Mr. Gopadze, who was <span class="locked">interpreting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In my presence. And the tone of the reply between this gentleman
and Mr. Gopadze, and back to Marina, it was quite evident there was a
harshness there, and that Marina did not want to speak to the FBI at that
time. And she was refusing to. And they were insisting, sir. And they implied
in so many words, as I sat there&mdash;if I might state&mdash;with Secret Service
Agent Gary Seals, of Mobile, Ala.&mdash;we were opening the first batch of mail that
had come to Marina and Lee's attention, and we were perhaps just four or
five feet away from where they were attempting this interview, and it came
to my ears that they were implying that if she did not cooperate with the FBI
agent there, that this would perhaps&mdash;I say, again, I am implying&mdash;in so many
words, that they would perhaps deport her from the United States and back
to Russia.</p>

<p>I arose and called Mr. Mike Howard of the United States Secret Service
into the back bathroom, and stated this to him. And I also stated that I realized
there was some friction here between the United States Secret Service and
the FBI to the extent that I was of the opinion that they did not want the
FBI at that time to be aware of the tape recording that had been made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Marina N. Oswald, that she had been interviewed, in other words, by the
United States Secret Service before the FBI arrived at the location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean that the Secret Service did not want the FBI to
know that they had taped an interview with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He said, "Robert, I cannot tell you what to do."</p>

<p>I did ask him if he would go over there to speak to him, and kind of tone
it down&mdash;if they were going to get anything out of her, they would not get it
that way.</p>

<p>And he said he would speak to her.</p>

<p>Approximately, at this time, the telephone rang, and he had to speak on
the telephone.</p>

<p>I returned to my chair at the table where we were still opening mail, and
again for the second time, the same implication was brought out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the FBI agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They spoke English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the interpreter whom you named&mdash;was he participating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. It was from the FBI agent, the other gentleman, not
named Brown, to Mr. Gopadze, to Mrs. Oswald, from Mrs. Oswald back to
Mr. Gopadze to the other gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the second occurrence of this implication, of the same implication,
I arose again, and Mr. Howard was walking across the room, and I
stopped him, and I told him for the second time, or requested for the second
time that he please say something to them about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak loudly enough to be overheard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I just asked Mr. Howard to please inform the FBI
that she had, to the contrary, been very cooperative from the time she had been
out there, up until their arrival. And, again, I referred to Mr. Howard the
reference there of perhaps the friction, or the condition that I assumed, that
they did not want the FBI aware of the tape recording at this time.</p>

<p>And his reply to me, he said, "Robert, do what you want to do. You certainly
absolutely are free to say anything you want to say."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I certainly did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say? You went over to the agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I went over to Mr. Brown, the agent I knew, who was
sitting at the end of the coffee table&mdash;it was a large round coffee table. And I
sat there, and I spoke to him without saying so much about&mdash;anything about the
tape recording. I did say to him&mdash;and I was shaking my finger at him, sir, I
might say that&mdash;that I resented the implications that they were passing on to
Marina, because of her apparent uncooperative attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Supposed, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>And that I knew for a fact that she had been very cooperative and highly
cooperative.</p>

<p>And I returned to my chair at the table.</p>

<p>They attempted for another 5 or 10 minutes to interview Marina Oswald at
that time, at which time Mr. Brown&mdash;he left the immediate area of interviewing
there, and came over and started speaking to me.</p>

<p>I do not recall what our conversation was. I think perhaps it was on what
had transpired out there prior to their arrival.</p>

<p>As the other gentlemen <span class="locked">arose&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Transpired where, prior to their arrival?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Out at the Inn of the Six Flags, prior to the arrival of the FBI
agents.</p>

<p>And as the other FBI agent arose rather disgustedly to end the attempted
interview, he walked to the door, opened the door, and spoke very harshly to
Mr. Brown, who was just kneeling down in front of me&mdash;he said, "Just cut it
off right there, Mr. Brown."</p>

<p>Mr. Brown indicated he wanted to talk to me some more. He just motioned
to him to cut it off right here.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown left and went outside with him.</p>

<p>About 2 minutes later Mr. Brown appeared again, and asked me to come outside,
which I did. And then the agent apologized to me. He said he thought I
was one of the police officers out there and not Robert Oswald&mdash;he was not aware
of who I was. At which time we went into the adjoining set of rooms, in the
presence of both agents, and Mr. Brown asked me if&mdash;it was his understanding
that Marina had been interviewed and had been cooperative prior to their arrival
out there, and I said this was so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the Secret Service mentioned as having interviewed her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The only expression was that, had she been interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown did use the term had she been interviewed. And my reply, I
believe, verbatim would be&mdash;my answer to that question, sir, is yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the Secret Service, as the interviewers, had been mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By Mr. Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Implied, sir, by Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the end of that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Representative Ford has a notation here to obtain from you all
the details on when you knew that your brother Lee wished to return from
Russia, and you have given us those details, have you not? The information and
knowledge came to you through the correspondence which now has been identified
and admitted in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had no other source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion with your mother with respect to
supplying funds&mdash;either her doing so or your doing so&mdash;to your brother Lee when
he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My mother did write me on one occasion, sir, requesting <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. I believe at this time she was residing in Crowell,
Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She wrote you a note?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Stating that if I wanted to help Lee in any way, that I had to go
through her to do it to the extent that she was going to handle everything, and
that she was demanding&mdash;and that was the word she used in the letter&mdash;that I
do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Send any funds that I might want to send to Lee to her, to
forward to Lee.</p>

<p>This I did not do, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you respond to that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you fix, approximately, when you received that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately July or August of 1961, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that letter, did you have any&mdash;well, in addition to the
letter, did you ever have a discussion with your mother on the subject matter of
supplying funds for your brother while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she had none with you, and none occurred in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What part, if any, did you play in assisting, if you did assist,
your brother Lee in his making of repayments of the funds he had borrowed
from the State Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did not assist him in any way, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He did not request it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not. He wanted to do this on his own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss that subject with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he so express himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you offer to help him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he refused?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time&mdash;let us confine it first to the period that your brother
resided with you in your home, upon his return from Russia&mdash;did he express
to you any opinion or make any comment on his regard for, or affection for, or
lack of affection for, or regard for Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject ever discussed between you during that month
that he was at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject ever discussed at any time thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion&mdash;obviously, you did&mdash;to observe the relationship
between your brother Lee and your sister-in-law Marina, in their&mdash;as
husband and wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did observe that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you please state what you observed in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I felt on two or three occasions that Lee's tone of voice to
Marina&mdash;not understanding what was being said&mdash;but by the general tone of
voice, that he was being overbearing or forceful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Inconsiderate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Inconsiderate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Inconsiderate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of her&mdash;some little thing she might want to do.
I say some little thing&mdash;something that she was going to do there at the
house or something, or was doing&mdash;I don't recall any specific incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall her reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was usually silence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Usually what, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Silence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A silence that indicated resentment on her part, or rejection on
her part, of comments your brother was making to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Generally, sir, I formed my opinion by the expression on her
face, and her reaction as indicated, that it was not very pleasing to her to be
perhaps reprimanded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the presence of somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us, if you will, please, from your observation of your
brother and Marina, during all of the period of time up to and through Thanksgiving
of 1962, her attitude towards your brother in the normal course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, it would be described as just a normal attitude of
a wife to a husband. They seemed affectionate&mdash;both of them appeared to
be&mdash;and I believe this still to be so&mdash;very affectionate to the baby June Lee
Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is your opinion, based on your observation during this
period of time, up to and including August of 19&mdash;Thanksgiving Day 1962&mdash;it
is your opinion that they led a reasonably normal married life, having in
mind all the problems that were facing them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother ever discuss with you any incident in which
he thought that Marina had been guilty of some misconduct&mdash;I don't mean
sexual misconduct, but did he complain about her conduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any kind or character, at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there ever a discussion in your presence by anyone, including
your brother and/or your sister-in-law, on the subject of his having physically
harmed her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The subject was never discussed in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it come to your attention at any time prior to November 23,
1962, or November 22, 1963, that your brother had inflicted some physical
harm on your sister-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see her when she had darkened eyes, as though a
black eye had been inflicted upon her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any other physical injury?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother, in her appearance before the Commission, has
stated, and implied, at least, that your sister-in-law Marina could understand
English and could read English&mdash;let's confine it to the period up
to and including November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>What is your opinion on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is my opinion even now, sir, if I may go a little bit
further, that her understanding of the English language is less than
what it appears to be. She does not understand a considerable amount
that she, by her actions, appears to understand. This has come to my attention
since her visit to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean since she appeared before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>She does not grasp enough, and by this I mean, sir, to any extent&mdash;perhaps
it might be best if I compared that with my experience with my children,
approximately a three or four year old&mdash;if that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, do I fairly state that your testimony, even
to the present time, and including all of the period preceding the present
time, in your contacts with her, it is your opinion that she has a very
limited command of the English language, whether you speak in terms of
reading or understanding or speaking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>I might further qualify that, sir&mdash;that she could perhaps speak more
English words than she can read or understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do not, therefore, share your mother's expressed view
and opinion that she understands the English language to a greater extent
than, to use the vernacular&mdash;than she lets on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your mother mention to you or has your mother mentioned
to you at any time any&mdash;or asserted any claims on her part, that
there were any stolen documents, either stolen from her or stolen from anyone
else, that would be relevant to this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she has not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Has he spoken to you about the disposition of funds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
might have come without a clear address or indication as to for whom
they were intended as between herself and Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she has not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Oswald, when your brother returned from Russia,
was there ever an occasion, to the time of his death, when he discussed with
you the subject as to why he had returned from Russia? This is, apart
from the correspondence. Did you ever have a discussion with him on that
subject, or he with you, or a discussion that occurred in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None, sir, that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is that likewise true of your sister-in-law? Did she
ever discuss it in your presence, or with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; at no time has she.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever inquire of either of them on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall at any time discussing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nor were you present at any time when anyone else ever
inquired of either of them on that subject, up to and including November 23,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from previous questions that you have no knowledge
of Marina ever having had a black eye or being otherwise molested or
beaten by your brother, or anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were members of your family together, including Marina, to
celebrate, to the extent it might have been celebrated, Christmas of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Christmas of 1963, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry&mdash;I misinterpreted that.</p>

<p>Christmas of 1963&mdash;Christmas Eve of 1963 my wife and I and my children
traveled from our home in Denton to the Martin's residence in Dallas,
Texas, and spent Christmas Eve, or the biggest part of that day, with
Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you remain over to Christmas Day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your mother present on Christmas Eve while you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether she was invited to attend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know, she didn't know you were attending
there on Christmas Eve, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion that occurred during the time of
your visit on Christmas Eve, 1963, of your mother? Was she mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have an opinion as to whether the Secret Service
kept your sister-in-law Marina secluded against her will following November 22,
1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have an opinion, sir, that they did not keep her secluded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you do not&mdash;all right.</p>

<p>Representative Ford is particularly concerned as to how stable a person
your mother is, which would be of interest, of course, I must tell you, to
the Commission, in judging the weight they might give to her testimony.
And while I did ask you some questions on that subject this afternoon, would
you give us your opinion on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, I would refer to my prior testimony on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing has occurred since that you would seek to elaborate
upon that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps one thing, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That occurred during the week of December 2, 1963. It came
to my attention from my wife, during the latter part of that week, that my
mother said on one occasion, when I talked to her over the phone, a phone call
that she had originated from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, while the Secret
Service agents were still present with her, as they were in my home in Denton,
Texas, that she turned around at the end of the conversation and said that I
requested that they leave her home. And this, to my knowledge, was the reason
why they left my mother's home prior to the time they ever left my home.
And, as a matter of fact, some of the agents that were at my mother's home
came out to Denton to stay at my home. And one of them had conveyed to
my wife what was said that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is an additional factor affecting your opinion as to
the stability of your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which leads you to the view that she, since this tragic event,
she is not as stable as she was prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And I might add, sir&mdash;I don't believe I stated this. I, of course,
did not request that the agents be removed from my mother's residence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>You have testified to ownership of rifles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you still own a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you own and possess a rifle&mdash;I will withdraw that.</p>

<p>Did you ever take a rifle to the Irving Sports Shop in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever been in the Irving Sports Shop in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anybody ever take any firearm owned by you or possessed by
you and take it to the Irving Sports Shop in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I inquire of you, Mr. McKenzie&mdash;I have a question here
dealing with the nature of Marina's contract&mdash;if there is still one between
Robert, Marina, and Thorne.</p>

<p>Do we have that contract?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, it is in evidence and has been given an exhibit number.</p>

<p>And I might also state that I have just left Mr. Rankin's office where I was
contacted by long distance telephone from my office in Dallas, Tex., and had
a letter read to me over the telephone that Mr. Thorne has sent to Marina
Oswald at the home of Mr. Declan P. Ford, in Dallas. Tex., to the effect that
he has had and received a letter from me, but regardless of my letter to him,
that she cannot unilaterally cancel his contract, and that his contract is one
that is coupled with an interest and that it would be to her best interest to
immediately contact him directly in order that certain probate papers may be
filed in connection with the death of Lee Harvey Oswald, to establish her community
interest under the laws of the State of Texas in the estate of Lee Harvey
Oswald; and, further that there was some $7,000 being held for Marina Oswald
in Fort Worth, Tex., subject to the payment of $100 by Marina N. Oswald,
and that likewise there were other business contracts needed to be affirmed
or discussed with Marina Oswald by Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>I might add in that connection that I have instructed my office to have Marina
Oswald bring the letter to my office this afternoon or this evening, have a photostatic
copy made of Mr. Thorne's letter, and I further instructed my office to
contact Mr. Thorne by mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, and requesting
in such letter to have Mr. Thorne contact me directly relative to the
representation of Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>And I have directed a copy of that letter to be sent to the Grievance Committee
of the Dallas Bar Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it there at least was, and there is a dispute about it at
the moment, as to whether it is still legally effective, an agreement between,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
or a contract between Marina on the one hand and Robert Martin and Thorne on
the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, Mr. Jenner. And all of those agreements are in the
record, and have been produced.</p>

<p>And I might also say that Marina Oswald had placed both Messrs. Thorne and
Martin on notice that she has discharged them as her attorney and business
agent, respectively, and, further, that I have likewise notified them since Mrs.
Oswald has turned the matter over to me.</p>

<p>And, further, for the purpose of the record, I will state that Mrs. Oswald
has paid me the sum of $25, which is not my usual fee, to represent her as a
retainer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do represent her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And I do represent her, and do not desire one dime out of
any contributions that she may have received by anyone for the benefit of
herself or her children, nor would I accept same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a written contract with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I have no written contract with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether Marina knows or can use or understand
any language other than Russian, and other than English, to the extent that
she is able to use and understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not. I do know that she knows a little French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the extent of your information on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you know that she knows a little French?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During her recent stay at my home in Denton, <span class="locked">Tex.&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How recent was that? Just a few days ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Within the past 10 days to two weeks&mdash;I believe this was brought
about, to the best of my recollection, due to a television commercial with a little
French involved. I gave my total French vocabulary of parlez vouz Français,
or something, and she replied to that. And we asked her did she speak French,
and she said four or five other words, and she said that was about all of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother ever speak to you or raise the subject of his
jealousy or possible jealousy concerning Marina and any other man or men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did any discussion of that subject or possible subject ever
take place in your presence by anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know any of the following members of the Russian
emigré group? I will omit those you have already identified.</p>

<p>George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever heard of that name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Teofil Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever heard the name before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever heard the name before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Frank H. Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you heard that name or know of it during the lifetime
of your brother Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You became acquainted with that name, with that person, subsequent
to his death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were the circumstances, and when?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On February 19, 1964, I went to Mr. and Mrs. Declan Ford's
home from Denton, Tex., on my way to Washington, D.C., to visit with Marina
briefly, and on arrival there Mrs. Ray&mdash;and I feel like this is the same one&mdash;was
babysitting with the youngest child of Lee Harvey and Marina N. Oswald.
Also, Mr. and Mrs. Declan Ford's child and her own child. And I had a cup of
coffee and waited on a taxicab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the extent of your acquaintance with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the first time you ever saw or met or heard of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your information, did Marina ever tease your
brother Lee in public?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she, in your presence, or to your knowledge, through other
means ever make fun of his ideas? Deprecate his ideas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever, in your presence, ever make any comments with
respect to your brother's sexual power?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject of sex as between your brother and Marina ever
discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you know whether any remarks of that nature were made
by anyone, including Marina, to or in the presence of your wife, Vada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has anyone or did anyone during the lifetime of your brother
ever discuss or raise the subject with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever during all the period of your brother's lifetime,
ever hear any discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you record in your memorandum, diary, all of the course of
events of November 22, 1963, in which you took any part? In particular, your
visit to the police station on November 22d.</p>

<p>What I am getting at, Mr. Oswald&mdash;if what you have written in your memorandum
represents your best and sharpest recollection of the course of events
recorded there as of the time you wrote that&mdash;that may satisfy the gentleman
who wished that inquiry to be made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Referring to the time I arrived at the Dallas police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the night of November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Is there <span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And any other visits that you made on the 23d or 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Other than what is in your diary, is there anything else you
could add to it in the way of expanding on what is in your diary?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, also in the interests of a chronological and connected record,
having in mind the context of the record when it is read, may I suggest that the
memorandum diary which we have identified and admitted in evidence, be set
forth in full in the transcript?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think it would be useful to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think this would be a good point to do that. I will ask Mr.
Oswald a few things.</p>

<p>Have you recorded in your notebook how the assassination of the President
first came to your attention, where you were, where you proceeded from that
point on, and what occurred with respect to the subject matter really from
minute to minute or hour to hour throughout the course of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And all of your conversations and your contacts with anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
during the course of the day having relation to the subject matter of the assassination
of President Kennedy on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the subsequent arrest of your brother and your visit to the
City Jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that likewise true&mdash;that is a detailed recording of the
course of events as you participated in them on the 23d and 24th of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. McKenzie has kindly asked a question that I would
wish also to join in and put to you.</p>

<p>Having glanced through the memorandum again, or read it&mdash;is there anything
you wish to add to any of the recordings that you have made in your
notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is that you might have been stimulated during the course
of the questioning yesterday and today to recall, that you did not recall at the
time you made those entries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir&mdash;not to the entries or material that is already in here.
Of course this is not complete to the extent it is my intention to complete at
least as fully as I possibly can the entire week out at the Inn of the Six Flags&mdash;and
possibly other events that has occurred to me since that time that would
be more in the nature of a personal nature than anything that perhaps the
Commission would be interested in. However, I might say that any time that
I do complete this, I would certainly turn it over to the Commission, if they or
my attorney deemed it necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you elaborate further on your memorandum, as I understand,
you will supply the Commission with a copy, and with your willingness also to
exhibit the original of what you add to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir, we shall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, you have read the memorandum. It does purport
to state in some detail and accuracy the course of events of the 22d, 23d, and
24th, and during that week.</p>

<p>Was there anything in the course of your reading that memorandum that
might have led you to pose any further questions of the witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. No, I think not at this time. I would have to go over it again
and I will do that. But, at this time&mdash;it seemed to me, as I read it, to cover the
area you have indicated.</p>

<p>I, of course, cannot myself judge the completeness of it. But it seems to
cover the points that I would have questioned the witness on if I had not had the
diary available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is this feature. Mr. Liebeler and I have not examined the
memorandum in depth with a view as to whether any thing said in it would
stimulate us to ask further questions. I read it last night, but not with a view
in mind of asking additional questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, I read it from the same angle. I read it during these
proceedings, and, therefore, I was distracted from time to time. I think it is
a very helpful memorandum from the point of view of the Commission.</p>

<p>Do you wish to&mdash;it has been introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But do you wish it put in this record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I would like to have it recited in full in the record. And
as I recall, you agreed, Mr. Oswald, to dictate&mdash;to take the memorandum and
dictate it aloud on a tape, and Mr. McKenzie will forward the tape to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have so agreed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And when you do forward it, would you kindly advise us at that
time if there is anything on a rereading of this memorandum which you would
like to supplement or add which you feel will be essential for the Commission to
have, or desirable for the Commission to have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I will certainly do so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And, further, Mr. Dulles, in the event that any of the attorneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
representing or working with the Commission see fit to be in Dallas in the course
of the investigation of the Commission, with a little notice Mr. Oswald will be
glad to appear and talk with them at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>And it is, of course, possible that we might wish to recall you. I am not at
all sure, and I hope that will not be necessary. But we always have to reserve
that for the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There may be other witnesses who will say things upon which
we would like your testimony.</p>

<p>For the period recorded in the memorandum, and the events recorded in the
memorandum, the recordings are full and complete, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if you wish, or should determine to add to it, it will be with
respect to matters that have occurred subsequently to those events recorded in
the memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. With one exception, Mr. Jenner. In the event there is some
recollection or something that is recalled to his mind, he would likewise add
that to the memorandum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I will direct that a photostat of Commission's Exhibit 323 describing
the events of November 22, 1963, and immediately following days
insofar as concerns the witness be incorporated in the record at this point.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 323 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you spoken to any member of the Dutz Murret family in
New Orleans since November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What knowledge do you have as to the cause of the split between
your sister-in-law, Marina, and Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The cause of that split, <span class="locked">sir&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What knowledge do you have of the split, first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Full knowledge of the split, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Will you tell us about it? What led to it <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Under my advice to Marina Oswald I requested that she sever all
connections with Mr. and Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you give that advice and make that request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Inn of the Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this the same occasion about which you have already testified,
and which consideration was being given, to whether your sister-in-law
Marina would reside with the Martins rather than with the Paines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was the first occasion, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it then from your present testimony, just answering my
present questions, that the discussion went beyond the question whether Marina
would reside with the Paines as distinguished from the Martins, and when I
say beyond, it went to the question of whether Marina would have anything to
do with the Paines thereafter.</p>

<p>Am I correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not fully, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Will you please explain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the extent that the question arose whether or not after our
first agreement that she would not live with the Paines, that question never has
been brought up again. The question has come up from Mrs. Marina Oswald.
The time I fix this second query or inquiry from her was approximately
December 20 or 21, 1963, at which time we were advised that Mrs. Paine had
written her a letter or letters requesting that she contact Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately December 20 or December 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina advised you that Mrs. Ruth Paine had written her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had written her, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Asking Marina to do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To contact Mrs. Paine; that Mrs. Paine wanted to speak with
her. I do not recall any specific reference as to what she had to speak to her
about. She just wanted to speak to Marina Oswald. She did not reply to these
letters. She asked me would it be all right in my opinion for her to call her on
the phone.</p>

<p>I recommended that she did not talk to Mrs. Paine at all nor answer her
letters and to my knowledge this request has been done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. To the best of your knowledge, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my knowledge she has not contacted Mr. or Mrs.
Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She has followed your admonition or advice to have no contact
whatever with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or to permit Mrs. Paine to have any contact with her, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. May I ask a question right there, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Oswald, your testimony is from the best of your knowledge,
is that correct, insofar as any contact with the Paines or Mrs. Paine is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And if the Paines have contacted Marina Oswald or if Marina
Oswald has contacted the Paines, do you or do you not know of any such contact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am not aware of any such contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right, sir. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I direct your attention to the month of October, 1962 for a moment.
Were you aware that your sister-in-law Marina was living with Elena Hall at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. October, 1962, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. One moment, please.</p>

<p>No, sir. I was not aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of where your brother Lee was living in the
month of October, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only to the city in which he was living.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what city was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Dallas, Tex., sir. If I might ask, sir, can you fix the date in
October, 1962 when Marina Oswald was reported living with Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, I can't at the moment. But neither Marina nor your brother
was residing in Fort Worth at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, they were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your previous testimony I gather that you did not know
the whereabouts of your brother Lee other than that it was, you supposed, somewhere
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>If I might make one correction, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Referring to the postcard received from Lee Oswald post dated
October 10, 1962 in Dallas, Tex., I recall receiving this two days after he had
moved from Fort Worth, Tex., so it would be the first part of October of 1962
they were residing in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>, All right, with the exception of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you are not in the habit of retaining personal correspondence
you receive from others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you have explained why you retained the particular correspondence
that you produced for us, that it was from your brother while he
was in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And after he returned you received some correspondence and you
retained that as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the somewhat abrupt change in the attitude of your brother
Lee toward the United States come as a surprise to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You are referring to the period in 1959?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the letters of May 5 and May 31 and those that followed.
But that change, and his desire to return to the United States, did come as a
surprise to you, is that correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Are you asking about his return to the United States or his
going to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, sir, his return to the United States, his change of attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was quite a surprise to me that he wished to return to the
United States from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the change in attitude toward the United States as expressed
first in the letters of November 8 and November 26, 1959, and then the series of
letters that commenced in the spring of 1961 a surprise to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not a surprise to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain both of your answers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There, sir, I felt like in the due course he would certainly change
his mind and opinion of the U.S.S.R., and I felt very strongly that after
a period of so many months or a year or two that he would change his mind
and return to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, prior to your brother's leaving Russia to return to the
United States, that is actually a day or two before, if not the day before they
left Minsk for Moscow, in May of 1962, your brother Lee outlined his projected
route by return to the United States. He spoke in that letter of leaving from
England and arriving in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I beg your pardon, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a difference in the route actually taken. Did you ever
discuss with Lee why that change in route occurred? Are you seeking that May
letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is probably the 22d of May and that is Exhibit 318.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have the letter before me. You are referring to
the letter of May 22, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it would appear from the notation handed to me. Is
there any discussion in that letter about the route of his return, projected
return, to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What does it say, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Well, we have finally gotten the word from the U.S. Embassy
and shall leave for Moscow tomorrow. We will be 10 to 14 days in Moscow
and then leave for England where we shall board a ship for America. The
transatlantic trip will take another two weeks or so."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the fact is that they did go to Moscow and then to Holland,
and boarded a ship at Holland, and as you say touched England and then
went directly to the United States.</p>

<p>Did you ever discuss with your brother that change in route?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not. And I did fail to read further on down
where it does refer to, as he put it, "will actually arrive in America probably
in New Orleans."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He actually arrived in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That subject matter was never discussed by you with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or by him in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or by Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With you or in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> Have you related, during the course of the day and yesterday,
called our attention to all of the correspondence between yourself and your
brother from the time of his return to the United States in June of 1962 to
and through November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. According to our records you and your wife, Vada, or either
or both of you, had the following contacts with the FBI during the lifetime
of your brother Lee. I direct your attention first, to the possibility of refreshing
your recollection, to the date of April 27, 1960.</p>

<p>Were you interviewed by an FBI agent on that day, and would the name
Fain serve to refresh your recollection on that score?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It certainly does, sir. I cannot recall the date of our interview
or our conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This would be in the spring, let us say, of 1960. I have given
you the date. Does that sound right to you, April 27, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It sounds approximately right, sir, because I do recall I just
started my employment with the Acme Brick Company in Fort Worth on the
18th of April, 1960.</p>

<p>I do not believe that it was that close to my date of employment with the
Acme Brick Company. I feel like it would have been perhaps 20 or 30 days
later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Subject to that, do you recall the interview, is the name familiar to you
as being the gentleman who interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what inquiries did Mr. Fain make of you? What subject
matter, first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He was inquiring as to whether or not I had heard from my
brother Lee Harvey Oswald recently, I believe that is the way it was put.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he at that time inquire of you on the subject matter of
your brother's defection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my remembrance, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. By subject matter, do you mean reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Reason or the fact that he had defected or what he might
have known about his defection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't discuss that. According to your recollection, there
was no discussion of that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject of the possibility of your being contacted by
any Soviet officials discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was discussed not in the term of Soviet officials. In case
<span class="locked">any&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Any Communist Party member or so forth along that line contacted
me, I assured him I would certainly, if necessary, take care of myself
or if I had time report it to his attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would report all contacts to the FBI either directly to
Mr. Fain or some other FBI agent or office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you agreed to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I most certainly did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you had any other calls from the FBI officers since that
date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we will get to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Are they pertinent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, they are and I think I have them listed.</p>

<p>Was the subject of the possibility of your receiving any request by any such
people for any item of personal identification of your brother discussed with
Mr. Fain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no present recollection of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is not&mdash;trying not to be repetitious but the author of this
memorandum is highly desirous of inquiring of you as to whether the subject of
personal identification of your brother was raised by Mr. Fain in any connection
or in any aspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I don't understand that question, what do you mean by personal
identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some item of personal identification.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Marks identifying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Wound or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Physical marks really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two classifications, physical marks how he could be identified;
secondly any items of identification, such as registration cards, things of that
nature. But first personal identification in the sense of physical properties. The
person of your brother Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe Mr. Fain did at that time inquire as to any scars that
might appear, that I was aware of on Lee's body. The only scar that I was
familiar with was the one over one ear, I do not recall which ear it was, where
he had a mastoid operation performed at an earlier date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is his right ear, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I still don't know, sir. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>In that connection, however, did Mr. Fain raise with you the subject that if
anyone inquired of you as to any items of scars or other possible identification
that you would in turn advise the FBI that such an inquiry had been made of
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir, and I might say it was my further understanding
that I did agree if anybody inquired about Lee in such a nature that
other than perhaps newspaper reporters, who were properly identified to me
and I did know, I would inform him or his office of this inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your present recollection as to aspects of identification was limited,
that is the only one you discussed with Mr. Fain was the fact that your
brother had a mastoid operation on one of his ears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you knew of no other scar or similar identification on his
body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you recall being again interviewed by Mr. Fain on September 18,
1961? This would be a couple of months, two or three months after
your brother returned&mdash;no, he is still in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He is still in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perhaps I may refresh your recollection an interview by Mr.
Fain with you respecting your then current knowledge of your brother Lee's
activities in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I inquire, sir, was this a telephone conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All that is reported to me in this memorandum is that Mr. Fain
again interviewed you on September 18, 1961 with respect to your knowledge
of your brother Lee's activities in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do believe that he did, sir, and I believe this was over the
telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By way of a telephone call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do not recall as of this time or approximately this time any
personal interview that is as distinct from interview by telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that during the course of that conversation you
advised FBI agent Fain that your brother had been critical of the Russians.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was in September 1961, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that you were surprised that the Russians would permit
such criticism to be conveyed to you by letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall that specific statement but I do not deny it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is possible that you made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the next date is May 18, 1962. Was to your knowledge
or by report from your wife, was your wife interviewed by the FBI on that date
or approximately that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My remembrance on that, sir, is that she was on or around that
date, and also by telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she report both occasions to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Would you please recite those, taking them in the order, what she said to you
and where and what the circumstances were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She was at our residence in Fort Worth, Tex., and she acknowledged
that Mr. <span class="locked">Fain&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she tell you that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. I might add very courteously, <span class="locked">inquired&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Mr. Fain was quite courteous in his inquiries of Vada?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes. He inquired over the phone as to whether or not we had
recently heard from Lee, and was there any indication about how his efforts to
return to the United States were progressing from that end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did it happen he called upon your wife, rather than you;
were you away at that time, away on business or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I don't believe I was, sir. I do believe Mr. Fain was courteous
enough perhaps not to call me at my office, and it was of such a nature that he
felt like perhaps my wife could certainly answer whether or not we had heard
from him recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she report to you as to whether any understanding had
been made by her, that she or you or both of you would advise the FBI as soon
as you had information as to when he might return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall her reporting that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had already agreed with Mr. Fain back in September, 1961,
to keep him advised of the comings and goings of your brother in any event,
did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I do not believe it was my intentions, nor do I believe
I conveyed it to Mr. Fain at that time, that I would, as soon as I did have notice
that when, or approximately when, he was going to arrive, that I would notify
them. This was certainly not my intention then. It perhaps didn't even occur
to me at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything to Mrs. Oswald, Mrs. Vada Oswald, when
she stated she had agreed to keep the FBI advised, or to advise the FBI when
you and she or either of you was further notified as to the time, if any, of your
brother Lee's return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, my wife did not advise me that she made any type of
statement to Mr. Fain of that effect. So, I certainly did not advise her to what
we would do or convey to the FBI when we did have knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection then there was no discussion on
that particular phase of your brother's presence in Russia on the occasion you
are now testifying about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you adverted to two occasions when the FBI interviewed
your wife. Was the second one June 26, 1962, or thereabouts?</p>

<p>In other words, approximately five weeks later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The date was June 26, 1962, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that would be correct, sir, or approximately correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> Did you have a conversation with Mrs. Vada Oswald on that
subject and did she make a report to you of any kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I believe this is the occasion that either Mr. Fain or
some other agent called the house in Fort Worth, Tex., and requested my wife
to pass on to Lee Harvey Oswald that they would like to see him at their
office in Fort Worth, Tex., for an interview.</p>

<p>This is the only other time my wife ever conveyed to me that the FBI had
called the home and spoke to her, nothing else was said about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This was about a month after his return, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion on this particular occasion between you
and your wife on the subject of her not advising the FBI of your brother's
arrival in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion on that subject at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she report to you that she had stated to Mr. Fain that your
brother Lee and his wife Marina and their child had come to Fort Worth and
were living with you and with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; she did not state that to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give again the full conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On that date of June 26, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, between yourself and your wife Vada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. To the best of your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my recollection, the full text of my conversation
with my wife was that Mr. Fain or some other member of the FBI Bureau in
Fort Worth, Tex., had called and spoke to her and requested that she pass on to
Lee Harvey Oswald that they would like to speak to him at their office in Fort
Worth, Tex. I would not say this was part of the conversation, I would assume
at that time, as I would assume now, that perhaps he asked her was Lee and his
family there.</p>

<p>If you know my wife, she didn't lie to Mr. Fain or any other FBI agent, and
she said he was, and perhaps this prompted the request. I might say this, sir.
If they did not know that Lee Harvey Oswald had returned in June, until
June 26, 1962, somebody was asleep on the job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would perhaps be inclined to agree with that, sir. But as far
as your conversation with your wife Vada is concerned, she said nothing that
she had advised the FBI that&mdash;she had discussed with Mr. Fain the fact that
she had not advised the FBI of your brother Lee's return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you recall an interview with the FBI, or they with you,
on August 14, 1962 or thereabouts in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, and I recall that this was by telephone at the general
office of the Acme Brick Company and outside of my office as I was leaving the
office to go to lunch that day.</p>

<p>The telephone call came through and I took it in another office and spoke to
Mr. Fain briefly. He <span class="locked">inquired&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He identified himself as Mr. Fain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you become acquainted with his telephone voice at least by
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that voice was the voice that you identified at that time as
that of Mr. Fain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What did he say and what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He inquired as to where Lee was living at at that time and to
the best of my recollection my reply to him was that I did not know the house
number. I knew the street not by name but by locale and I gave him this
location.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> Would you please tell me what you said to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That to the best of my recollection, that this duplex was located
across the street from the side of Montgomery Ward located on West 7th Street
in Fort Worth, Tex., approximately three or four blocks from West 7th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Chairman, you have greatly inconvenienced yourself this
evening and accommodated both myself and Mr. Oswald for which we thank you.</p>

<p>However, it is now 16 or 17 minutes of 8 o'clock in the evening, and Mr.
Oswald has been testifying here for, to the best way I <span class="locked">can&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It will be 12 hours pretty soon, 11 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Approximately 11 hours and by the same token Mr. Jenner
has been questioning him for a like period of time, with the exception of the
few questions you have asked and the few questions I have asked, and I submit
maybe we should start again in the morning.</p>

<p>And I likewise say that he is perfectly willing to go forward but I do know
that you have plans and if we can <span class="locked">meet&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will have to do it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. We can be here at 8:30, if it will suit the <span class="locked">Commission's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. 9:30 tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>And we will adjourn at 11 o'clock, come hell or high water.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 7:45 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT EDWARD LEE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission met at 10 a.m. on February 22, 1964, at 200 Maryland
Avenue NE., Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Present was Allen W. Dulles, member.</p>

<p>Also present were Albert Jenner, assistant counsel; and William McKenzie,
attorney for Robert Edward Lee Oswald.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>We will continue the hearing of Mr. Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Have you now recited for us all of the occasions on which any agent of the
FBI called or visited with you prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And your answer would include any other Government investigatory
bodies, would it? I mean you didn't have the Secret Service at this
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. In answer to your question, Mr. Jenner, and to Mr. Dulles'
further question, Robert has told me there was one other agency that he does
recall at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why don't we have him recite it, and then see if it is pertinent.</p>

<p>Or, may I suggest, Mr. Chairman, we might go off the record and see what
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It was Immigration and Naturalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the date, please.</p>

<p>Excuse me.</p>

<p>There was one other Government agency that interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give the time, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my recollection, this was approximately January
or February of 1962, at my residence in Fort Worth, Tex., approximately 7
o'clock or 7:30 p.m. The gentleman had called my home from Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> Had he called you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he had called my home, and my wife had talked to him,
and he asked if it was satisfactory if he came over to ask us some questions and
some background information in regard to Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a week day or a Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was a week day, sir.</p>

<p>My <span class="locked">wife&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you become informed of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My wife called me at my office, sir. And she advised the gentleman
on the phone unless I said to the contrary it was certainly satisfactory for
him to come that night, which he did, at approximately 7 or 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I was there, and my wife was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he give you his name, and do you recall what the name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am sure he did give his name, but I do not recall
what his name was.</p>

<p>It was a rather brief meeting and conversation that we had, and it was with
regards to the possibility or inquiry into the possibility of having Lee's wife,
Mrs. Marina N. Oswald, brought to this country, with Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As best as you can, would you reconstruct the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This gentleman did take notes or perhaps he did have a form
outlining various questions that he needed answers to. I do not recall any
specific questions. However, I did state to him, after three or four questions,
in regards to Lee Harvey Oswald being in the Soviet Union, and quite surprised,
I do recall, myself that he was not aware of the reasons why&mdash;or the reported
reasons why Lee had gone to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>And I suggested to the gentleman at that time that he perhaps contact the
FBI and I specifically mentioned Mr. Fain by name&mdash;he said he was acquainted
with Mr. Fain of the FBI Bureau, and that he would get the background information
from Mr. Fain in regards to Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>I believe, sir, to the best of my remembrance that he stated at that time he
was not aware of the situation, and he thought this was just an "ordinary" case
of bringing an immigrant in from the Soviet Union to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when he said that, what person did you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the person to whom you thought he was referring, was
Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And this was after, as I recall, your correspondence showed
that they were planning to come back, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you give us a little more of your recollection as to the
thrust of his inquiries, the subject matter of his inquiries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, the best of my recollection on that would be
directed to us at that time about Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what nature&mdash;her age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall any specific questions, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did they inquire about the marriage? That would be one
of the things they would inquire about. Because it would be the marriage
to an American that would give her the preference. I was wondering if that
might have been the subject of the inquiry&mdash;whether you had evidence that
she was married to your brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall that specific question, but perhaps this
ground was covered. It was just a general background on Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it did relate to Marina N. Oswald?   You recall that much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the questions were directed toward her and about her
specifically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. More so than Lee Harvey Oswald. Some questions were
addressed to me by the gentleman in relation to my brother, Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the inquiries of the agent&mdash;he inquired of you as to whether
you were the brother of Lee Harvey Oswald, did he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sure he did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am just trying to reconstruct the scene for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And whether your brother Lee Harvey Oswald was then in
Russia, and had been in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether he was married, and married to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was he familiar with Marina's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he was.</p>

<p>I might further add, sir, if I may, that the gentleman advised me he assumed
that Lee was employed by the Government in some capacity in Russia, and
not having any background or apparent background of Lee's reported reasons
for going to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you make any response to that, when his conversation
was such as to indicate that he was not fully advised of the circumstances
under which your brother had entered and remained in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did&mdash;to the extent as I have already testified.</p>

<p>I believe perhaps at this point, if not this exact point, I referred him to the
FBI Bureau and Mr. Fain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ask you&mdash;did he inquire whether you had received correspondence
from your brother, or the extent to which you had been in touch with
each other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These are horribly leading questions&mdash;but I take it then his
inquiries were largely directed toward, as a representative of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, obtaining information as to Marina, whom he understood
to be the wife of your brother, who, in turn, was about to return to the
United States with Marina, then a citizen of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did this interview last?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 30 minutes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your mind's eye is that he had a form, or he had some set
questions which he was asking from a sheet of paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than the typical FBI or Secret Service inquiry, in which
the questions range, as mine have, for example, largely dependent upon what
your answers to the previous questions were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>I believe the gentleman did have some type of set form as to questions he
was referring to when he spoke to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he go into your family background, your own age, your
occupation, and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir; he just went into my background, as to the extent
of my relation to Lee Harvey and Marina N. Oswald at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe this gentleman, please&mdash;his physical appearance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If you recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my remembrance, I would describe this man to be
average build, rather short, approximately 5-foot 9 or 5-foot 10, perhaps in
his middle forties or early fifties. I do recall, sir; if I might further add, as
the gentleman was leaving the house that night, I requested of him if it was
possible for him to notify me when and if Marina's visa would be accepted
or not, and he replied to me at that time that he could not do that. And I
replied back to him that I guess I would know about it from the extent that
if she arrived over here, it was approved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now exhausted your recollection of this particular
incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question there?</p>

<p>Do you recall that at any time the State Department was in touch with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
over this general period&mdash;that is, the period of your brother's stay in the
Soviet Union, or his prospective return here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; at no time was I aware of any member of the State
Department being in contact with me.</p>

<p>And I might further add that at this particular time, after the Immigration
and Naturalization agent was there, including my prior testimony as to the
contacts with the FBI Bureau, these were the only times prior to his arrival I
was in contact with any Government agency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any agency of the Government of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, were you consciously in contact during any of that period
up to November 22, 1963, with any agent or agency of any other government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>And I might further add that no one else other than perhaps my close friends
inquired as to my contact with Lee Harvey Oswald during that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You have related to us an incident of your brother being interviewed by the
FBI, and he reporting back to you either that evening or that same day of
that interview. That is the one in which your brother reported to you that
inquiry had been made of him as to whether he was an agent of any agency of
the United States, and you responded&mdash;I have forgotten now just how you
phrased it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Well, don't you know, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in addition to that particular occasion, were there any
instances in which you were directly advised or advised by your brother or by
Mrs. Vada Oswald of any other interviews by any agent of the United States
Government with your brother, after his return from Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, to the best of my remembrance on that question,
that I was advised by Lee Harvey Oswald, after he and his wife took up residence
on Mercedes Street in Fort Worth, that the FBI had contacted him and
held an interview with Lee Harvey Oswald in their car in front of their apartment
on Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say in their car, you mean the automobile of the
agents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that approximately the middle of October&mdash;I mean the
middle of August?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it would have been approximately the middle of
August 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother reported that to you, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the first information you had about it&mdash;that is, did it
come through your brother initially to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had indication from Mr. Fain, when he called me at
my office, inquiring as to where Lee was residing at that time, that they did
want to speak to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>And I take it, then, that Mr. Fain had called you at your office, as you testified
yesterday, shortly before this interview took place with your brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire of your brother about it, or did he volunteer it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He volunteered the information, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have forgotten now.</p>

<p>Have I had you recite what your brother said to you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; you have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please state that&mdash;and who was present when your
brother related this to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my remembrance of that occasion, sir, it was in
the presence of my brother, myself, and his wife, Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In their home, or your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In their home, on Mercedes Street&mdash;either the afternoon or
the following day of the interview. And he just simply stated to me, sir, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
the FBI had been by and had held an interview with him in their car in the
front of their residence on Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he tell you anything about the thrust of the interview, anything
that had been said, what the inquiries were of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your recollection now serves you only to say that he did report
to you that FBI agents had interviewed him in their automobile, in front of or
near their apartment on Mercedes Street&mdash;2703 Mercedes Street&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall the number of the house, sir. I do recall it was
at the Mercedes Street address, and I have exhausted my recollection of that
particular occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall what you said or what others said&mdash;that is, others
in addition to your brother&mdash;on that particular occasion, when he recited the
event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any further comment about that particular
event at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There is one question I would like to ask at this point.</p>

<p>This is slightly on a different subject.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marina Oswald, as I recall&mdash;and I don't know whether you were present,
Mr. Jenner, when she gave this testimony or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She stated that in the later period she had the impression
that your brother was trying to break off a little with, I might call it, the
Russian group in Fort Worth that he had had a good many contacts with. That
is when they called, he did not seem to welcome their coming, and they slowly
stopped coming. I think this was to the house on Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Do you have any recollection of that? Did you know about that? Did Marina
speak to you about that? Or did your brother speak to you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or did you have any impressions about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do have impressions about that&mdash;at that particular
time when they were residing in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>If I may, <span class="locked">sir&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It was Fort Worth when this took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mercedes Street is in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you sort of start at the beginning, and give us what impressions
you had, as to how this impressed you, as an incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>During the period that they resided at the Mercedes Street address, I was
of the opinion&mdash;and I was present on one occasion at the Mercedes Street
<span class="locked">address&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you fix the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This would be approximately the latter part of August 1962, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It would be subsequent to this interview by the FBI agents with
your brother in the automobile near their home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my recollection, I would say that would be so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That Mr. Paul Gregory had retained Marina in the capacity
of teaching him the Russian language, and he in return was paying her a certain
amount per hour for this instruction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how did you come by that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On the night that I was present at the home or apartment on
Mercedes Street, I was <span class="locked">informed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By Lee Harvey Oswald&mdash;that Mr. Paul Gregory was due to
arrive at any moment, to take him and Marina driving around Fort Worth,
Tex. During this period Marina and Mr. Paul Gregory would converse in the
Russian language, and that she would be paid by the hour for her time, and
for the instruction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was present on this occasion when your brother told you
that, in addition to yourself and your brother?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Marina N. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your brother spoke in English, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your knowledge and present recollection, did
Marina understand what he was relating to you? Did he make it apparent to
her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, to the best of my recollection that generally she
was apparent to what he was saying to me. I do feel like she certainly recognized
the name of Mr. Paul Gregory and was able more or less to fill in the
conversation to the extent that she understood that Mr. Gregory was due to
arrive, and that they were to converse in the Russian language for his benefit.</p>

<p>And it was my understanding at this time, either implied or stated to me, by
Lee Harvey Oswald, that this was not the first occasion that this had occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Dulles, if I may interrupt at this time&mdash;you have brought
here with you this morning a copy of the New York Times which you have
very kindly allowed me to look at and read.</p>

<p>On page 22 of the New York Times, Saturday edition, February 22, 1964, there
is an article <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I may add I have not read the paper yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. There is an article here by Mr. Anthony Lewis, correspondent
for the New York Times, dateline Washington, February 21, which I would like
to put into the record.</p>

<p>Now, the reason I would like to put it into the <span class="locked">record&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. McKenzie, would it suit your convenience if we finished
this incident, and then you put this matter into the record, or is it pertinent
to this particular point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It is not pertinent to this line of inquiry, Mr. Jenner. But
with the Chairman's permission, I would like to insert it into the record, or
make a statement into the record at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It is all right&mdash;go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It is apparent to me, from a reading of this article, that
someone other than Robert Oswald or myself has made a statement to the press.
We have consistently stated to the press that Mr. Oswald was under oath
before this Commission, and that being under oath before this Commission he
was in no position, or that it would not be an appropriate time for any statement
to be given to the press.</p>

<p>And yet in this article, Mr. Lewis has given some direct quotes, or what
appear to be direct quotes, of Mr. Oswald's testimony before this Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if it would be agreeable to you, if we go off the record
at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If I may still be on the record for one more second, please, sir&mdash;I
would like to further and say that some of the text of this article gives testimony
in the same light, and nearly in the same manner in which Robert Oswald
has testified.</p>

<p>Now, if there is a leak to the press, or if anyone on the Commission or its staff
are giving articles to the press, then I want to know as soon as possible, because
if that is so we will go down and have a press interview, and I just don't think it
is fair to the witness, nor do I think it is fair to the Commission.</p>

<p>And if you feel that I am right in my statement here, then I would like
to have this article inserted in the record.</p>

<p>Now, if you would like to go off the record, that is fine with me, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just for a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Dulles, off the record we have discussed the New York
Times article, and I have stated to you&mdash;the New York Times article referred
to as the one by Anthony Lewis, of February 22, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think it is of February 21, but reported in the Times on February 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>I have stated to you that at no time to my knowledge has Robert Oswald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
given any statements to the press as set forth in this article, particularly his
testimony to the Commission.</p>

<p>And, further, that both Robert Oswald and his counsel have stated to the
press that while Mr. Oswald was under oath to the Commission, and subject
to recall by the Commission, that he would not issue any press statements,
because I have likened it to a grand jury investigation, and I have stated this
to the press.</p>

<p>And I did not deem it appropriate at any time for him to make any statements
to the press of his testimony before this Commission.</p>

<p>And yet there are&mdash;I find in this article by Mr. Lewis, dateline February 21,
certain excerpts from his testimony before the Commission&mdash;and it can come
from only one place, and that is from someone on the Commission's staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, I may wish to make an exception to that&mdash;having been in
Washington a long time, and knowing that things have a way of leaking, and
many ways of leaking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Well, sir, I will state to you&mdash;maybe my statement is too
strong.</p>

<p>But I will state to you, sir, that at no time has Mr. Oswald or myself made
any statements giving testimony to the press which has previously been given
to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am very glad to hear that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And, <span class="locked">further&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have every confidence in that. As a matter of fact, I have
been with both of you most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And, further, if it has been given to the press by someone
other than the people in this room, and I feel confident it was not given to the
press by anyone&mdash;because I have either been with you, Mr. Dulles, or Mr. Jenner.
But I feel that the Commission should investigate this to see if there is a
leak, and, if so, I feel that it is reprehensible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I will present your statement to the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Do you wish to identify the statements to which you take exception?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I will identify it this way.</p>

<p>Let me just identify it this way: "His brother told the Commission that Lee
seemed changed when he returned to the United States. He had lost a lot
of hair, which Robert said was unusual for their family, and he appeared to
be under a strain."</p>

<p>"Robert testified that the last time he saw Lee before the assassination was
at Thanksgiving in 1962."</p>

<p>Now, I offer that, sir, for the record from the standpoint that that is testimony
given to the Commission and quoted in this article.</p>

<p>There are other items or matters in the article which Mr. Lewis could have
received from public records, or from newspaper morgues, or newspaper records.
However, the two quotes that I have given from this article are direct testimony
from the Commission, from the Commission's records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think in fairness, Mr. McKenzie, they are with respect to
subject matter. I don't think they are direct quotes of the witness' testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. But you will agree with me, won't you, Mr. Jenner, that they
are in respect to subject matter, matters testified to before the Commission by
Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The subject matter of the hair, yes. I recall specifically asking
Mr. Oswald about that yesterday. We had not inquired of the witness about
that prior to that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I might further add, sir, that I am familiar with the statements
made to the press by you, Mr. Dulles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think you heard both of them that I made yesterday before
the morning, afternoon and evening sessions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir; I did. And I would be remiss if I did not add that
I know that you&mdash;when you have made statements to the press, you have been
most fair, both to the press, to the Commission, and also the witness.</p>

<p>And I am in full accord with the statements that have been made to the
press by yourself, by Mr. Rankin, and by the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>I might also add, Mr. Dulles, if I may, sir, that the only reason I bring this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
up is that I do feel that Mr. Robert Oswald is under strict&mdash;the strictest of
oaths to give his testimony only to the Commission, in the interests of finding out
the truth, and that he has not given any statements to the press nor have I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. On that latter point, I would say that I appreciate and respect
the position that you have taken in this respect, that in the case of previous
witnesses, the Commission itself has no authority to, as I understand it, and
has not attempted to "muzzle" witnesses that have appeared before it as to what
they themselves may say after the hearings.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice has enjoined them during the hearings not to discuss the
proceedings.</p>

<p>Am I correct, Mr. Jenner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And that is exactly the position we are taking, sir. And that
is exactly the position that we have taken, and will continue to take at all times
while he is under oath to the Commission, and until such time as he is released
from that oath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, I will see that your statement is brought specifically to the
attention of the Chief Justice and Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Shall we proceed, Mr. Jenner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, thank you, sir.</p>

<p>When the discussion of the Times article arose, you were in the process, Mr.
Oswald, of relating to us an incident of one evening in the home of your brother,
in which&mdash;with respect to which Paul Gregory, the son of Peter Gregory, was
expected to arrive at your brother's home and then to drive about the city of
Fort Worth with Marina, she talking to him in Russian and he likewise in
Russian, as part of a course of instruction in conversational Russian between
Marina and Paul Gregory, who was seeking to improve his command of the
Russian language. And you had reached the point at which you related a conversation
with you in the presence of Marina, which you thought she understood
and she took sufficient part, in to lead you to believe she did understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that refresh your recollection as to where we were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And I would like to add, as I understand it, it was indicated to
you by your brother that this was to be on a financial basis&mdash;that is, she was in
effect giving Russian lessons to Paul Gregory, and would be paid for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any amount of money mentioned? It was by the hour, I
think you said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; a figure was mentioned. However, I do not recall the
exact figure. I could perhaps to the best of my ability and remembrance of the
occasion place the figure at over $3 an hour.</p>

<p>I do not recall any further conversation that I had with Marina and Lee
Oswald on that occasion.</p>

<p>I did leave their residence before the reported time that Mr. Gregory was due
to arrive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything occur that evening, in the course of that interchange
and conversation, that had a bearing upon, or led you to believe or have the
impression, that your brother Lee was seeking to break off or lessen relations on
his part and Marina's part with their Russian friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask one question there?</p>

<p>Did your brother indicate whether these lessons were being given in his and
Marina's home, or whether they were to be given at the Gregory home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. It was implied if not stated to me at that time that
the lesson was to be given going around Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This particular occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get any impression, Mr. Oswald, as to the course of procedure
in that respect for any future occasions, or those that had occurred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
the past, because I believe you indicated that your impression was that this was
not arising for the first time that evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall anything being stated at that time or any
other time where these lessons were to be given other than my impression of
that one night that it was to be given as they drove around Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I correct in my impression of your testimony that your impression
in turn was that this relationship had existed at least somewhat before
this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then would you proceed to the next circumstance or event which
led you eventually to the conclusion or impression that your brother was seeking
to lessen the relations between themselves, he and Marina, and their Russian
friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the contrary, sir, that was the only time that I recall that any
people of Russian descent or interested in the Russian language was mentioned in
my presence, and I base my opinion on that particular incident that they were
not at the time seeking to lessen their relationship within this group of people
when they did reside at the Mercedes Street address in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>I had been under the impression, Mr. Oswald, from your first immediate response
to Mr. Dulles' question on this subject, that you had stated or at least
indicated&mdash;I had that impression&mdash;that you had noted somewhere along a point
of time while they were on Mercedes Street, some effort on the part of your
brother to lessen the intensity at least of the degree of intercourse between
themselves, that is he and Marina, and their friends of Russian derivation. Am I
correct in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe you are incorrect in that, sir. I believe I stated to Mr.
Dulles that to the contrary at that particular time they were not attempting
to lessen their relations with this group of persons. And I cited the incident
of that night as they awaited on the arrival of Mr. Paul Gregory as an example
that they were still in contact at least with that member of Mr. Gregory's family,
if not Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It may well have been that the testimony that we previously
had related to a subsequent period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That may well be.</p>

<p>I was not here when Marina testified.</p>

<p>It does lead me, Mr. Chairman, however, to make some further inquiries on this
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old, in your judgment, if you have an impression, was Mr.
Paul Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I would place his age at that time approximately 20
or 21 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I believe you testified last evening that you had met Paul
Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you gain any impression that evening that prior contacts
between Paul Gregory and your brother and sister-in-law in this area had
embraced other occasions when they, meaning Marina and Paul Gregory, had
driven about the city of Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I was of that opinion&mdash;whether it was stated or implied,
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you state for us a little more in detail any remark that
led to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any specific remark that was made at
that time. But I was, as I am now, of the opinion that there were or had been
prior interviews or lessons between Marina Oswald and Lee Harvey Oswald and
Mr. Paul Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is prior occasions when this method of conducting a lesson
had been pursued&mdash;that is, just driving about the city of Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did there occur subsequently any further occasions in which
the conducting of lessons by Marina with or for Paul Gregory arose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to the time that they had left Fort Worth, which, as I recall,
was the day after Thanksgiving, 1962, did there come to your attention, either
through your brother or Marina or some other source, the undertaking by
Marina to give or participate in lessons to persons other than Paul Gregory,
the teaching or increasing the facility of use of the Russian language on the
part of someone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. And if I may, sir, to understand the question fully&mdash;you
referred to the day after Thanksgiving, 1962, as the day that they had left
Fort Worth, Tex. They had given up their residence on Mercedes Street in the
early part of October 1962, and moved to Dallas, Tex., address unknown to me.
On the occasion referred to on Thanksgiving 1962, it was my understanding that
they returned to Dallas when they departed from my home in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are absolutely correct.</p>

<p>I did misstate your testimony. But up until the time they did leave, were
there any further occasions on which you received the impression, at least,
that Marina had been engaged, either for compensation or voluntarily in teaching
conversational Russian or increasing the facility or use of the Russian language
by someone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not acquainted with any other persons that perhaps
she had pursued this line of employment with, or volunteered to instruct
anybody else in the use of the Russian language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that exhaust this subject, Mr. Chairman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes. You may proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time before Marina and Lee left Fort Worth to go to
Dallas, did you become aware of her, at least from time to time, living with
others in the city of Fort Worth&mdash;that is, not living with your brother in their
home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald; I anticipate that a series of names which I am
about to put to you would in large part be strange to you, but one of the other
divisions of the investigation staff desires me to inquire whether any of these
names are familiar to you.</p>

<p>Prior to November 22, 1963, did you or your brother, Lee, or any member of
the Oswald family&mdash;that would include your brother John and your mother&mdash;as
far as you know hear of any of the following persons:</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I withdraw that question and put it to the witness first.</p>

<p>Did you, at any time prior to November 22, 1963, know of or hear of any of
the following persons:</p>

<p>One, George Senator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that name is unfamiliar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ralph Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will assume that each of those questions the name is also
unfamiliar to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>If you would like, may I suggest that you read the entire list and if any
of them are familiar to me I would stop you on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Andrew Armstrong; Karen Bennett, also sometimes known as Carlin; Bruce
Carlin; Roy William Pike, alias Mickey Ryan; Robert Kermit Patterson, alias
Bobby Patterson; Donald C. Stuart; Charles Arndt; Stanley or Katch Skotnicki;
Larry Crafard; Eva Grant; Joe Bonds; Joyce Lee McDonald, also known as
Joy Dale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not heard of any of those people mentioned by
name, nor am I familiar with any of their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as far as you know, none of the members of your family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
including your brother Lee, and Marina, knew of, or were acquainted with any
of these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this likewise would include your wife Vada and your
mother and your brother John?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether or not your brother Lee ever visited any
of the following night clubs, bars, or taverns or restaurants in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area:</p>

<p>The Bullpen Drive-In; the Carousel Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, Mr. Jenner. This is prior to November 23, 1963&mdash;is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will repeat the list.</p>

<p>The Bullpen Drive-in; the Carousel Club; the Vegas Club; the Sovereign
Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not aware at any time that he did enter these
establishments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you been in any of these establishments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This leads me to ask you about your brother's drinking habits,
if any. Did he take an occasional drink&mdash;I mean of intoxicating liquor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my remembrance, sir, on that particular point,
I have never known him to take a drink of an alcoholic beverage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you been with him on occasion when you have had
alcoholic beverage, whereas at the same time he declined to have any, or did
not have any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any occasion such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there occasions on which you would have drawn to your
attention the fact that your brother was not a drinking man&mdash;even a social
drinker?</p>

<p>That is, were you present when others might have been having a social drink
at which your brother either declined or just didn't have one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any such incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a firm recollection or opinion, in any event,
that your brother was not a drinking man, even a social drinker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And am I correct that you did testify a moment ago that there
was never an occasion when you saw your brother imbibe an intoxicating
liquor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Marina in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There, again, sir, we are referring to the time prior to November 23,
1963, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, let's take that first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Nor was I present on any occasion that she did take a drink of any type of
alcoholic beverage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I will take the period from the 22d of November to the
present time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have been in her presence on a number of occasions
where she has taken a drink of an alcoholic beverage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And has it been just an occasional drink, purely social drinking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may qualify one point of that statement, as to being a
social drink&mdash;during the period that we was at the Inn of the Six Flags in
Arlington, Tex., the baby, Rachel Oswald, being breast fed, and due to the
nature that she was quite upset at that particular time, that she was not eating
proper, and that they were having some difficulty&mdash;she was having difficulty
maintaining the natural milk supply in her own body for the baby, that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
six-pack of beer was brought in, and at no time did I see her drink other than
one beer at a time or one beer per day to help fortify herself in this production
of milk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear any conversation in which your brother
participated or Marina participated with you or in your presence respecting the
subject of his or her or their attendance at any night club, bar, tavern, or
restaurant in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and when I use the word restaurant,
I am thinking of a restaurant in which intoxicating liquors or entertainment
might be employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry I keep referring to this point again, sir, but this was
prior to November 23, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. That is, your brother and Marina were not in the
habit of&mdash;you know of no occasion on which they attended bars or restaurants
with entertainment which might be described as night clubs and that sort of
thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it that is not your habit, either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. To your knowledge, did he have any friends in this circle, the
nightclub circle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not that I was aware of, sir, prior to November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know of any friends or classmates or associates, either
of yourself or your brother Lee, who have become nightclub entertainers? And
may I say that includes so-called stripteasers or musicians or singers, or masters
of ceremony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may refresh my memory to the question, sir, you did include
myself in that statement, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only gentleman that I was ever in a remote way acquainted
with who has become perhaps what might be determined an entertainer as you
have outlined was a boy that attended high school with me in Fort Worth,
Tex., and he is now known as, as then&mdash;I believe his correct name is Mr. Van
Williams. If I might pinpoint the series of programs on television that he
appeared in was Surfside Six, and other western and detective type series programs
on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether your brother was acquainted with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would be of the opinion, sir, that he was not acquainted with
Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you know of any friends, classmates or associates of
either yourself or your brother Lee who have become waitresses, bartenders, or,
to use the vernacular, bouncers?</p>

<p>You know what a bouncer is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>To answer your question, sir, I do not know of any that are personally
acquainted to myself or that I would be of the opinion that were acquainted
with Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the same question as to members or employees of any gun
clubs or shooting ranges, rifle ranges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes; 1 am acquainted with at least two people who have joined
or belonged to a gun club or something of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please identify them, and also state whether or not
your brother Lee was acquainted with these people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Bill Harlan, formerly of the Acme Brick Co., in Fort Worth,
Tex., and Mr.&mdash;I am quite sure that Mr. Harlan is not acquainted with my
brother, Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>The other gentleman is Mr. Jewel Godi, of the Acme Brick Co., in Denton,
Tex., who is not acquainted with my brother Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it these two gentlemen you have identified are fellow
employees of Acme Brick Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Or ex-employees that have become my personal friends, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know&mdash;I will withdraw that, because it would be
repetitious.</p>

<p>What kind of gun clubs&mdash;hunting clubs, or gun practice clubs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Harlan belonged to an archery club in Fort Worth, Tex., that I believe
was also part of a gun club.</p>

<p>And Mr. Godi belongs to a Denton gun club of the nature of a practice
range.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know of any possible homosexual tendency or activity
of your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any information as to whether he at any time met
with suspected homosexuals or whether he went to the places reputedly frequented
by homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your brother's attitude toward sex in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not have an opinion on that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any opinion whether it was a normal, healthy
attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say it would be a normal, healthy attitude, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have, any&mdash;do you know what his attitude was, if he had
one and you are acquainted with, toward homosexuality and homosexuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not of any opinion on that particular question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this series of questions which I have been asked to put to
you, I intended to include his entire lifetime. And were you answering the
questions with that in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. I would not change my own answers on that basis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether or not any of the persons whose names I
read to you, that series of names, beginning with George Senator, and concluding
with Joyce Lee McDonald, contacted any member of your family or
friends subsequent to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any employer or fellow employee of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it from your previous answer, which was that these
names were unfamiliar to you, that they certainly did not contact you&mdash;at least
you did not know consciously that they contacted you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is not, I anticipate, fully repetitious, Mr. Chairman, but an
inquiry has been made&mdash;I just want to make certain of it.</p>

<p>Were you at all aware as to whether in October of 1962&mdash;aware of the fact,
that for a short time Marina resided with Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you aware that there was for a short period of time
some argument or fight between your brother and Marina which may have played
a part in her visiting in the home of Elena Hall for a short time in October 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, sir, this is all completely new to you. You have no
information on this subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were not aware of anything of this nature at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. McKenzie described at length yesterday Mr. George De
Mohrenschildt. As I recall it, your testimony was that you were unacquainted
with this gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear either your brother&mdash;were you present when
either your brother or Marina discussed, or may have discussed Mr. De
Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you aware of any threat that your brother uttered against
or may have uttered against Mr. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not aware of any threat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now aware of the photograph of your brother with the
pistol on his hip and holding the rifle and also holding a sheaf of papers, are
you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you see that photograph by any chance at any time prior
to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not. Or did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were unaware that it had been taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know that your brother had either the gun or the pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or had acquired the gun or pistol?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina, following November 22, 1963, herself also acquire
the same antipathy that you have testified you had with respect to the Paines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would be of the opinion, sir, that she has not or does not have
the antipathy that I have to the Paines. However, I feel confident that she has
followed my advice along that line, and not contacted Mr. or Mrs. Paine since
November 23, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you have the impression that Mrs. Paine had some ulterior
motive, other than a good motive, desire to befriend Marina when she was in
some distress, and to gain the chance to talk Russian with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I would not have an opinion of that, since I was not
aware of the circumstances of how they did become acquainted, and consequently
started living in her residence in Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I gathered from your previous testimony that your feeling,
visceral feeling, related both to Mrs. Paine and to Mr. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did. More so, if I might add, sir, to Mr. Paine than
Mrs. Paine. But still I will include both of them in that answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you know anything of Mr. Paine's background and
affiliations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You knew of Mrs. Paine's interest in learning Russian, did you
not, and in Russian matters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Following November 22, 1963, this has been reported to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. By Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I believe I read this in various reported news articles
and magazines that she has stated this was her intention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And Marina did not talk to you about either of the Paines
particularly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to any extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your information with respect to the Paines, other than your
meeting them, I believe you said, the evening of November 22, and later in the
Inn of the Six Flags, is based primarily&mdash;in addition to that&mdash;on items you
have read in the newspaper and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, to fully understand the question, you referred to a meeting
of Mr. and Mrs. Paine at the Inn of the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought you said that Mrs. Paine&mdash;or was it Mrs. Ford in the
Inn of the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; neither of the ladies you have mentioned were in the
Inn of the Six Flags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then your whole acquaintance with the Paines was your
being introduced to them, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that is not correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate your acquaintance with the Paines, and
when it first arose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The first occasion that I met Mr. and Mrs. Paine, was at the
Dallas police station on the night of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask there&mdash;had you heard about them before?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Hadn't even heard about them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not. And my subsequent second meeting with
Mr. and Mrs. Paine&mdash;and I might add my last meeting with Mr. and Mrs.
Paine&mdash;was at their home in Irving, Tex., on the day that Mr. John Thorne,
Mr. Jim Martin and myself&mdash;for the purpose of picking up Marina N.
Oswald's and Lee Harvey Oswald's personal belongings. This was the only
time that I have met them since the night of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did anything transpire on that occasion, when you were taking
up Marina's and your brother's belongings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps, sir, the only thing that I recall that would perhaps
be of some type of significance was that Mr. Paine, at the approximate
time we were ready to depart from his home, called me over to the
side and stated that he would like to know where Marina was staying, and
they would like to be in contact with her. And my comment to him was
that Marina was leaving the area, and that she was to be well taken care
of. And at that time we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know whether the Paines have been in touch with
Marina since that particular time, when you left the Paine's home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my knowledge, sir, they have not in person been in contact
with Marina Oswald. However, it is my understanding from Mr. Jim
Martin and Mrs. Marina Oswald that Mrs. Paine has written a number
of letters to Mrs. Marina Oswald during her stay at the Martin's home in
Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know the content of those letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know whether Marina still has them in her possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would be of the opinion that she does, sir. And the only
comment she had made to me directly, or Mr. Martin perhaps made to me, as
to the contents of the letters was that they wanted to talk with Marina,
they wanted to be in contact with Marina in person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Oswald, during all of the time that your brother and
your sister-in-law Marina resided in Fort Worth, Tex., were you aware
of any occasion when your sister resided or visited with, and lived with,
anyone else other than your brother Lee in their home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, if I may correct you&mdash;you referred to her as my sister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I meant sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not acquainted at any time that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any knowledge or acquaintance with whether
Marina did any shopping on her own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. During the period that they were in Fort Worth, Tex.,
sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I am acquainted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate your knowledge in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A conversation with my wife on return home from work
one afternoon, approximately the latter part of June 1962&mdash;correction, sir.</p>

<p>It was not a conversation with my wife&mdash;it was a conversation with my
mother, at approximately the latter part of August 1962, or the first part of
October 1962. And, to the best of my recollection, the conversation was
to the effect that Lee Harvey Oswald had gone downtown in Fort Worth,
Tex., looking for a job, and that Marina wanted to find Lee while he was
downtown, and even though reportedly from my mother that she insisted
that she not leave the house, she did, carrying the baby, June Lee Oswald
with her, and walked approximately 15 or 16 blocks into downtown Fort
Worth.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that she became lost or needed assistance in
her directions, in her attempt either to find Lee Harvey Oswald or return home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
that she asked the assistance of a police officer, and that apparently she did not
have any other difficulty.</p>

<p>It is my understanding at that time that she did purchase either some
baby clothes or perhaps some clothes for herself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was all related to you by your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does that exhaust your fund of knowledge as to any shopping
trips or visiting and shopping at a local shopping center or stores by Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;prior to November 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The diary, or memorandum, has considerable information, you
may recall, with purchases that were made by others for Marina and the
child, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That was afterward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may, sir, I do recall another instance.</p>

<p>In the presence of myself, Lee Harvey Oswald and Mrs. Marina Oswald
and the baby June Lee Oswald, approximately the middle of June 1963&mdash;the
occasion was a grocery shopping for my family and <span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. June of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you, sir. June of 1962. And this was to my
<span class="locked">knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your statement 1963 was a slip of the tongue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>And there was, to my knowledge, at that time the first occasion that Mrs.
Marina Oswald had ever been in a supermarket of the nature that is found in
the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about the occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I remember the occasion quite vividly. If you ever have the
opportunity, sir, to take a person of that nature into a supermarket or an
average size store, and watch the expression on their face, as to the magnitude
of the food and the variety of the food that was in her presence&mdash;and I believe
for the first time to any extent&mdash;it was quite a pleasant observation, I
might add, sir. She was quite overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surprised and overwhelmed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. <span class="locked">Surprised&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There is nothing like it in Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel certain, sir, there is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get the impression that her reaction was such to indicate
that at least she had never seen anything of this nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I was of the exact opinion she had not seen anything
anywhere comparable to that in the nature of a food store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did you get the impression this was a spontaneous reaction
on her part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Most certainly it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was not putting on an act to impress you and Lee and anyone
accompanying you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is of interest, Mr. Chairman, particularly the spontaneity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was that in Dallas or Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This was in Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is while they were living with you, Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did this arise? Did you just decide&mdash;was this part of
showing her Fort Worth, or was it developed from desiring to go to the supermarket
to purchase something, or was it a combination of both?</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I believe it was a combination of both.</p>

<p>If I might add, the store that I went into was not the store that I usually
purchased groceries from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were leading&mdash;you were doing the leading of this party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, in addition to yourself and Marina, who was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Only the baby, June Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just the two of you going, and you were showing her around the
town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And you made some purchases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we did. And she made some purchases. Or she selected
some items.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Can you tell us whether Marina had from time to time a certain
amount of money for her own disposition? Did your brother Lee leave her
money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge that he did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it be your impression that he did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It would be my impression that he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would appreciate it if you would proceed to tell about your
taking her around on this particular day, and her reactions, perhaps, to other
things that you showed her in Fort Worth at this early stage of her being in this
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Her reactions in the supermarket, sir, as I have testified, I
believe to be completely spontaneous, and certainly from all appearances it was
entirely new to her. I do recall we started off in the section of the store&mdash;do you
want me to name the store, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you might do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It was a Safeway Grocery Store, located on Camp Bowie and
Ridglea addition of Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it Camp Bowie is the name of a street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you obtained any additional impressions as you made this
tour of Fort Worth, that is, as to her reactions to her new surroundings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. She reacted to a walk that we took after leaving the
grocery store and drove across the street to a suburban shopping center, with
a large variety of different type stores. I do not recall going into any particular
store. We were, as the term is applied, window shopping. And she was quite
impressed at the articles of clothing, of jewelry, of shoes, and such items as
might be displayed in this type of suburban shopping center which would more
or less encompass a full variety of practically everything other than large
appliances at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>At any time prior to November 22, 1963, did you become acquainted with her
habits, if any, with respect to independent shopping on her part&mdash;that is, shopping
by herself for foodstuffs or articles of clothing for little June or for herself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None other than, sir, that I have already related as related by
my mother to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name Hutch's Market familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified yesterday that, as I recall&mdash;and if I am incorrect,
please correct me&mdash;that your impression at least was that your mother was
opposed to your marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I correct up to that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without the degree of that opposition. Was it quite affirmative?
Did she make any scene? Did she talk&mdash;express to you unequivocally her
opposition?</p>

<p>Give us those circumstances, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall any specific instance where she firmly
stated that she was against my marriage. It might have been little things
along that line she might have said to me that I do not recall formulated my
opinion that she was to some degree at least having objections to my marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But did you have the feeling, and was it conveyed to you, that
she was quite affirmatively opposed to your marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say generally; yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did Marina and your mother stay at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In what period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before they moved to the Executive House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Right after November 22&mdash;maybe the night of November 22. I
think they had a room and moved out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought the witness referred to the Adolphus Hotel yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He has not referred to the Adolphus Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that is right.</p>

<p>My first occasion to meet with my mother and Marina Oswald on November 23,
<span class="locked">1963&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Was at the Adolphus Hotel, rather than the Baker Hotel, as
noted in my notes on page 10, in my diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I had noted that, Mr. Oswald. And would you identify the page
to which you have reference now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Page 10, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Page 10 of your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right. And I might point out at the time I wrote it
down in parens&mdash;"I believe." In other words, my statement was "I received a
call from mother while at the DA's office, and she advised she was at the Baker
Hotel&mdash;I believe."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your recollection has now been refreshed that that was the
Adolphus Hotel rather than the Baker Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I am of the opinion now it was the Adolphus Hotel
rather than the Baker Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then the next day they were moved to or themselves moved
to Executive House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that is not correct. They were moved later on, on
Saturday, November 23, 1963, to the Executive Inn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Executive Inn that is called?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than Executive House?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They went from the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas to the Executive
Inn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. That is my understanding, that they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were those quarters, as far as you recall, retained for them by
the Life people, Life, Time, Fortune people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In my conversation with my mother on Saturday, November 23,
while I was at the district attorney's office in Dallas, Tex., she related to me at
that time that they had furnished her and Marina Oswald and the babies three
rooms at the Adolphus Hotel, and that Life magazine was paying for these
rooms, and that they could keep these rooms as they wanted&mdash;as long as they
wanted to be close to Lee and the situation that was erupting in Dallas, Tex.,
at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Did you, during this period of time, have occasion to visit them at the Adolphus
Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that recorded in your memorandum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then I don't wish to burden the record by asking you about
it again.</p>

<p>Did you have occasion to visit them at the Executive Inn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that recorded in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Identify the page, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That begins on page 14, at the bottom of the page, under the
date of Sunday, November 24, 1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on that same day, did they move to the Inn of the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right&mdash;later on in the afternoon, Sunday, November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you accompany them on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did. I was in a separate car, but they were in the
same party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All three phases, Mr. Oswald&mdash;Adolphus Hotel, Executive Inn,
and the journey to and living at the Inn of the Six Flags, they are recorded
in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there come a time when differences arose between Marina
and your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You have covered that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I will submit it to the Chair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I would think so. I think that has been covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Did you want me to answer that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We don't want it if it is repetitious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that has already been testified to, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the course of the days immediately following November 22,
1963, whether at the Adolphus or the Executive Inn or the Inn of the Six
Flags, did any time arise, any talk with you or in your presence, of a supposed
possible conspiracy between the Secret Service men on the one hand and
Marina on the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; there was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing of that character arose, as far as you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I may say to you, Mr. Oswald, that the purpose of asking
you that question is a statement made by your mother that there was a conspiracy
between Marina and the Secret Service to turn Marina against your
mother and against your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, or the memory of your
brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would say to the best of my remembrance of all happenings
at the Inn of the Six Flags that at no time, to my knowledge, was there any
type of conspiracy of that nature, and at no time was I aware of any type of
conspiracy that would even resemble that statement, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As I recall, however, you have testified that you discussed with
the Secret Service the type of interrogation that the FBI were carrying on, and
that has been fully presented in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Following November 22, 1963, you saw a good deal of Marina,
did you not in those few days? You were guiding her and advising her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you already testified that on at least one occasion, or maybe
two, that you had taken her to your brother's grave in the cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; on quite a few other occasions also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And in your memorandum or diary&mdash;I don't know how we
described that, but I think variously as memorandum or diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would say memorandum, except the last pages a diary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. In your memorandum you have recounted certain problems in
connection with the funeral arrangements. Is there anything else you would
like to add to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the basis of your participating in the course of events subsequent
to November 22, and your continuing presence at the Inn, and advising
your sister-in-law, Marina, do you have an opinion as to whether the Secret
Service or anyone else was overly influencing Marina? Or even that they
were attempting to influence her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe that&mdash;perhaps I did not get the full statement
there. I believe you included anyone, including the Secret Service agents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could we confine it to the Secret Service first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>In answer to that part of the question, I would say I felt like they were not
attempting to influence Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it be your impression that they were trying to be completely
fair, even leaning over backwards? Or do you have any impression in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do have an impression and opinion on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That I felt at no time during our stay at the Inn of the Six
Flags during the week of November 25, 1963, including Sunday, November 24,
1963, that the United States Secret Service agents that were present at one
time or another did anything other than to be extremely helpful to Marina,
and not to the point of attempting to affect her judgment or to, so to speak,
put words into her mouth, or in any way lead her with relation to the events
that had occurred on November 22, 1963, or prior events that she had recorded
on her tape recording interview in the Inn of the Six Flags, or the events that
happened Sunday, November 23, 1963, until the time she left the Inn of the Six
Flags.</p>

<p>In other words, they conducted themselves in a highly admirable way at all
times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you give us your same opinion with respect to the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As I testified yesterday, sir; I was of the opinion on the first
and the second interview&mdash;and I refer to the first interview as I did yesterday as
an attempted interview, and I referred to the second interview, to the best of
my recollection it was the second interview, at which time the FBI, in my
opinion, kept Marina Oswald in an interview to the extent that it had almost
entirely exhausted her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this the occasion you related to us yesterday, or is this
another one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; this is the second occasion, when there was an interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please tell us about that, and when it occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. This interview occurred approximately Wednesday night, November
27, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Inn of the Six Flags, at which time the FBI agents and
Mr. Tom Kelley, of the United States Secret Service, left the room that we had
been staying in with Marina Oswald and went to the adjoining set of rooms
that was located, of course, right next to the room we had been staying, and
commenced an interview. It is my understanding that Mr. Kelley was not present
at this interview.</p>

<p>However, he was in the adjoining room to that set of rooms, and that he was
not permitted to be within the immediate interviewing area.</p>

<p>I do not recall the exact length of this interview. But as the night progressed,
it became at least apparent to me that due to the state of Marina Oswald at that
time, considering all the things that had occurred, and the difficulty that she
was having producing enough milk for the baby Rachel, that they were extremely
disregarding her own personal welfare at this time.</p>

<p>And I did go to the adjoining rooms, and I believe Mr. Kelley opened the door.
And at that time I related to him that the babies had awakened, and that they
needed their mother, Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>He immediately informed the interviewers in the next room. And as my
memory serves me, Mr. Kelley turned to me and stated he was glad I did that,
and I stated to him that the babies were still asleep, and I did it on the very
purpose of stopping the interview, too, to the length and the nature of Marina's
welfare, and to the extent that that was quite late at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were you present during the whole interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not. I was in the adjoining rooms, keeping an
eye just in case the babies did wake and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was there an interpreter present at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was that FBI or Secret Service interpreter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my memory, sir, that was Mr. Lee Gopadze of the
United States Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Gopadze was participating in the interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But only as interpreter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have an opinion as to whether Marina was or is involved
in any plot or conspiracy in connection with this affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I have the first part of that question again?</p>

<p>(The reporter read the question.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have an opinion to the contrary?</p>

<p>That is, that she is not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am of the opinion, sir, that she is not involved in any conspiracy
or was involved in any way with the event that took place on November 22,
1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask a question there?</p>

<p>Do you have any opinion as to whether any American security service, Secret
Service, FBI, CIA, were in any way involved in any conspiracy or plot or
otherwise involved in this whole affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, you are asking me of my opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Only your opinion, yes&mdash;obviously if you have information or
any evidence we would like to have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not have any evidence or information along that
line. I do have an opinion, sir, qualified to this extent. That it is very difficult
for me to feel that Lee Harvey Oswald acted entirely on his own without any
assistance whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now, whether this assistance was from my&mdash;from any member of any government
agency, or just individuals, I do not know. I do feel like he had
assistance of one nature or another, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Robert, that does not answer Mr. Dulles' question. And I
want you to answer his question fully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. My question was really directed toward any security agency
of the United States Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If I may state your question, Mr. Dulles, to Mr. Oswald&mdash;his
question was whether or not any security agency of the United States
Government, whether it be the FBI, the Secret Service, the CIA, or any Government
agency, had any part in a conspiracy or plot dealing with the events
of November 22, and what your opinion is concerning the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is correctly stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I would correct my answer to this extent, sir. I would be of the opinion that
no agency of the United States Government was in any way involved with the
assassination of the President of the United States on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Does that answer the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or in any way involved with your brother's, Lee Harvey Oswald.
Would you go that far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When we say involved, sir&mdash;excluding the interviews that I
am aware of and so forth. Yes, sir; I would be of that opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. To which you have testified with regard to the FBI and the
Immigration and Naturalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate further, please, when you first undertook
to answer Mr. Dulles question&mdash;you made some references to an opinion on
your part that your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, must have had some assistance.</p>

<p>Would you please state what you had in mind there? Assistance with what,
sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My opinion on that, sir, would be that, concluding that Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Harvey Oswald did actually shoot the President of the United States and
Governor Connally of Texas on November 22, 1963&mdash;I do feel that he did have
assistance to the extent that perhaps some money was given to him, and that
other types of assistance, such as perhaps training and orientations as to perhaps
the method to be used.</p>

<p>I believe that would conclude my opinion on the assistance I had reference
to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is based, I gather from what you have just said, on the
assumption or opinion&mdash;I will say assumption first&mdash;that your brother Lee
Harvey Oswald did assassinate President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you have that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That he did assassinate the President of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On his own, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he handle the gun and shoot the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's take it in alternatives. You state it in your own words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. He has stated this once before, but I am going to ask him
to state it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I would like to have that clearly stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, as I previously testified to that question, based on the circumstantial
evidence that has been put forth and that I have read from the
newspapers and general impression of the time that the event took place, and
the subsequent following days of that event, that I would be of the opinion,
purely based on these circumstantial points, that he did actually fire the rifle
that killed the President of the United States and wounded the Governor of
Texas, Mr. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The same would apply to the attack on Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would base my opinion on Officer Tippit's death, sir, on my
conversation with the District Attorney of Dallas, Tex., on the morning of
Saturday, November 23, 1963, at which time during our conversation he said
in his mind and based on the evidence and the eye witnesses, that he was
reported to have, that there was no question to him that Lee Harvey Oswald
did in fact kill Officer J.&nbsp;D. Tippit in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And you believe that would be correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe that would be correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had any conversation with <span class="locked">Marina&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just one point on that.</p>

<p>You have testified that you felt that your brother did have or would have
required some outside help or assistance to do what he did&mdash;roughly to that
effect, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Have you any idea at all or any thoughts as to what kind of
help, where that could have come from, who was involved.</p>

<p>I have in mind&mdash;was this in your opinion a rightist plot, a leftist plot, an
anarchist plot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I may take your question, sir; in the parts that you pointed
out&mdash;I believe the first part was to where and how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May have assisted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The where and the how, sir, I am not of any opinion. And as
to who might have assisted him, as related in my diary, or <span class="locked">memorandum&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Identify the page, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On page 6&mdash;and I quote&mdash;"I still do not know why or how, but
Mr. and Mrs. Paine are somehow involved in this affair."</p>

<p>I am still of that opinion, sir.</p>

<p>And as to any other persons that I might suggest was involved in any way
in this affair, I do not know of their names nor can I identify them in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. As this covers two of my <span class="locked">questions&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why don't you proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I proceed at this time.</p>

<p>I will proceed with a couple of questions I have at this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Pardon me, sir; may I interrupt you here? And I would like
to add something to my previous statement there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Please, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps there is one other person that I feel like would be
involved in this affair, and the subsequent death of my brother, Lee Harvey Oswald,
and that was the man that actually shot Lee Harvey Oswald, Mr. Jack
Ruby or Mr. Rubenstein. And that would be the only other party that I could
possibly attempt to identify that I feel like would have been involved and
perhaps assisted Lee in this assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please give us the basis of your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am of the opinion, as previously stated, based on newspaper
accounts and magazine articles of Mr. Ruby's activities, to the best of my remembrance,
as reported in one newspaper I recall reading after November 24,
1963, that a period of a couple of months, 2 or 3 months, prior to Mr. Ruby's
killing my brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, in a Dallas police station, that he appeared
at the Dallas police station and started making acquaintances at the
Dallas police station to the extent that he, from then on, appeared frequently
and was able to move about the Dallas police station very easily.</p>

<p>Based on that and the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald, I am of the opinion
that Mr. Ruby did in fact know Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Sunday, November 23,
19&mdash;Sunday, November 24, 1963, and that he was in my opinion paid to
silence Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This is based on&mdash;this opinion is based on what you have read
in the press subsequent to November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. November 24; sir, 1963, the day of my brother's death. Up
until that time I had never heard of Mr. Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I was including all of the press accounts that carried through
from the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, the witness has referred, of course, to events immediately
preceding November 22&mdash;that is Mr. Ruby's apparent interest in&mdash;his frequent
visits to the quarters&mdash;did you say the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; the Dallas police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I was trying to get at also&mdash;to cover what you had previously
said about possible aid in connection with the assassination of the President.</p>

<p>Is that based largely on what you have read subsequent thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This question of mine covers the whole period of your relationship
with your brother.</p>

<p>Do you recall during that entire period, up to November 22, that your brother
made any comments with regard to President Kennedy of a derogatory nature
or character or of any other character? Did he ever discuss the President with
you during the whole period? Of course, he was only President for the last
3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall at any time that he ever mentioned
President Kennedy's name or referred to him in any way, either pro or con.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Governor Connally&mdash;the same question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not as Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Or as Secretary of the Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; to the extent that he had mentioned his letter to
Governor Connally, his request for his assistance in correcting the dishonorable
or undesirable discharge that he had received from the United States Marine
Corps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What was his comment with regard to Mr. Connally, Secretary
of the Navy, and later Governor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. If you recall, go ahead and tell him. But it is covered in
some of the letters previously introduced into testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If there was any discussion, I would like to have that. And I
take it, Mr. Chairman, you are interested in that as well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am interested in that, because there has been some testimony
here from Mrs. Oswald to the general effect that he had not expressed any
antipathy to Secretary of the Navy and Governor Connally, but rather the contrary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
I would like to get your impression of that, what he might have said to
you on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I do recall a conversation at my home in Fort Worth, Tex., between myself
and Lee Harvey <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fix the time, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately the middle part of June 1962, at which time
the subject was brought up by him about his efforts to have the discharge
corrected to an honorable discharge, and that again he advised me that he
had written to the then Secretary of the Navy, John B. Connally, and that Mr.
Connally, or his office had replied that he was no longer the Secretary of
the Navy, and that he had turned over the correspondence to the then Secretary
of the Navy, Mr. Korth, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Fred Korth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall any further discussion on that subject. And
he did not indicate to me the pro or con of any antipathy toward Mr. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He expressed no antipathy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As a person, he did not make any comment, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he at any time, apart from this particular event you
are now relating, at any time prior to November 22, 1963, ever express any
antipathy toward Governor Connally as a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you ever hear Marina Oswald express any views about
President Kennedy one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall at any time that she has expressed
any views on Mr. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you recall at any time that Lee Harvey Oswald expressed
antipathy to government in general, people in authority, leaders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did he express any&mdash;apart from the letters, what he said in his
letters to you, which we have&mdash;but after he returned from the Soviet Union, and
during the period you saw him, subsequent to his return, did he ever discuss with
you the failures of government, that government itself was not good, or if the
kind of government we had in the United States was not good, as was expressed
to some extent in the letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not recall at any time other than in his letters
during the period of the latter part of 1959, at any time that he made any
derogatory remarks about any official or any particular leader or the government
of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And that statement would include General Walker, would it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it most certainly would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He never discussed General Walker with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I never heard him mention the gentleman's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did your brother have any sort of pet hatreds, institutions,
people or otherwise, that he disliked, apart from what he said in his letters?</p>

<p>I am talking now of the period after his return from Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; to my knowledge he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I have nothing further at this time. I may have one last question
at the end.</p>

<p>Do you wish to follow up on any of these points?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; not right at the moment.</p>

<p>Would you take your diary. There are one or two items that I would like
to clear up.</p>

<p>Page 1&mdash;you speak of the old Denton plant and the new Denton plant.
Would you please locate those plants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They are both located at Denton, Tex., and they are located
approximately a mile apart, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are the plants of the Acme Brick Co. by whom you are
employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> And the reason I asked you about these is that you talk about
going from the old to the new plant, and I wanted to locate them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The incident in New Orleans in which your brother was distributing
literature of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee&mdash;did that come to
your attention at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when was the first time that you became&mdash;you ever heard
of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, or anything about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this to be, sir, to the best of my remembrance, on
Friday night, November 22, 1963, at the FBI office in Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are referring there, I assume, to Lee Harvey Oswald's connection
with the committee, aren't you? Or are you referring to the fact
whether he knew there was a committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Both.</p>

<p>I will separate those. Did you know there was such a committee at any
time up to that occasion&mdash;had you heard of its existence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Perhaps I had read about it in the paper and not recalling any
significant value to myself I perhaps had forgotten about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then I will ask you the other part.</p>

<p>Had you heard of any connection on the part of your brother with or any
activity on his part with respect to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, prior
to November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You knew nothing of his short arrest in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You didn't even know he was arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. I did not even know he had traveled from Dallas, Tex.,
to New Orleans, until that night of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Page 2 of your memorandum&mdash;you recited there that an announcer&mdash;I
assume a radio station announcer&mdash;called you. Did you find that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do find the area that you are referring to. The announcer
did not call me, sir. It was the radio announcer on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>And what did the announcer say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my remembrance, sir, the announcer stated that
a man identified as Lee Oswald had been arrested in connection with a policeman's
death and possibly the death of the President of the United States on or
about that approximate time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that the first intimation of any kind or character, or the
first notice or knowledge to you, of the possible involvement of your brother, Lee
Harvey Oswald, either in the murder of Policeman Tippit or in the assassination
of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where were you when that announcement was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was in the office of the new Denton plant when this announcement
was made, or at least I first became aware of the announcement on the
radio at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you give us your immediate mental reaction when
you heard that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, my reaction to that would be somewhat stunned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Stunned in the sense of disbelieving? You just could not absorb
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to that extent. If I may say this. My own
personal mental attitude, through my entire life, seems to react to trouble
to the extent that I do not perhaps go to pieces, so to speak, that I react
apparently calmly in the face of adversity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it with that disposition that you have that anything
in life is possible&mdash;no matter how extraordinary it may seem at the moment&mdash;you
retain a grip on yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; or at least attempt to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were disbelieving, but it might have been&mdash;at least your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
thought was that it was possible, though, you were disbelieving at the
moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you state in your memorandum on page 2 that you
immediately called your wife Vada.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went directly to the phone and called her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I asked her first had she been listening to the television or
the radio set, and was she aware that Lee had been arrested. She stated
she had not heard this, even though she had been listening to television. In
her statement to me, to the best of my recollection at that time, was that
they had not, over the television set, referred to Lee by name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, as I recall in your memorandum, you immediately told her
you were going to come right home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did depart for home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On page 3 of your memorandum, you make a reference to your
brother's arrest.</p>

<p>Would you find that place on page 3? The report to you of his arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as I recall, that was a report to you that he had been
arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By whom, and by what means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Over the telephone, by Mr. Dubose, the credit manager in our
Fort Worth general office. And, "Bob, brace yourself, your brother has
been arrested."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Yes; I know. I just heard."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Mr. Dubose elaborate? Did he say only your brother has
been arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. To the best of my recollection that was his exact
words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he add, if I may refresh your recollection, assuming it is
so, that he had been arrested in connection with the assassination of President
Kennedy, and the murder of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I believe I did not give him an opportunity, if he
wanted to state that, to complete his statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now given us the whole of that particular conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>If I might add&mdash;other than that as noted on page 3, that he did advise
me that my mother was trying to reach me, and gave me a number to call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish to go to that next. You did call her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was she? To where was your call directed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To Fort Worth, Tex., to which address I am not acquainted,
but the telephone number is her residence in Fort Worth, Tex. I believe that
to be 1220 Thomas Place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you called that number, your mother was home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>What did you say to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My comment to her that this was Robert, and she immediately
started advising me of what she had heard, and that she had been in
contact with a Star Telegram reporter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the Star Telegram reporter for the Dallas Star
Telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, for the Fort Worth Star Telegram, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And that she was going to go to Dallas in the presence of this
Fort Worth Star Telegram, and she asked me did I have enough money to
fly down immediately.</p>

<p>I advised her I was 35 or 30 miles away from Dallas, Tex., that I was not
in Arkansas, and that it was my intention to go to Dallas just as fast as
possible. And she stated that she believed she would stay at the Baker Hotel,
and asked me to meet her there.</p>

<p>I agreed to this. However, this meeting never did take place at the Baker
Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A meeting did take place at the Adolphus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir. As prior testimony&mdash;at the Dallas police station, on
the night of November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You referred to, on page 3&mdash;to a Fort Worth general office,
and a gentleman by the name of Reger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the Fort Worth general office of the Acme
Brick Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned another gentleman there. I don't know if I read
your writing correctly. <span class="locked">Bill&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Darwin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak with him on that occasion that you related in your
notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the purpose of your talking with those gentlemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The purpose of talking to Mr. Darwin was to advise him that I
needed to go to Dallas, and his immediate reply was yes, he had just heard&mdash;I
believe he did say&mdash;about Lee, or about my brother, and that I was to do just
anything that I deemed necessary and not worry about the office.</p>

<p>And he did inform me at the latter part of this conversation that the FBI
had called the Fort Worth general office in an attempt to talk to me or to locate
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was any suggestion made by him at that time that you get in
touch with the Fort Worth Office of the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I advised him that I would contact the FBI upon completion
of our conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a reference to <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. By telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A reference to that appears on page 4 of your memorandum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't go into that interview. But on that occasion, and all
other occasions when you had interviews with, or were interviewed either by
the FBI or Secret Service, you related the whole truth and nothing but the
truth to the best of your knowledge and information at the time you were being
interviewed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this moment, had you contacted anyone other than those you
have now mentioned?</p>

<p>Up to this point of the sequence of events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. May I qualify that question&mdash;outside of my office in Denton,
Tex., sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The office in Denton, Tex., the call to your mother, the call to
Mrs. Oswald, your wife Vada, the call to the FBI office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are all of the contacts that you had and all of the occasions of
interviews during the period November 22, 1963, through the following week,
November 25, recorded in your memorandum?</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if to save time we could ask him to review that memorandum
and to report if he finds that there are other calls that were made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will that be acceptable to you, Mr. McKenzie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr Dulles, it is a quarter of one. Being as how it is a quarter of one, I
know you have a luncheon meeting to go to. Our plane does not leave until
5 o'clock. We have to leave here no later than 3:30. We will be glad to have
lunch and come back, if it would suit your convenience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are a couple of things, in the interests really of Mr.
Oswald, that have turned up, when I studied the memorandum last night, that
I am sure Mr. McKenzie would like to have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes; I would like to give Mr. McKenzie plenty of time.</p>

<p>If the car is there, I can wait another 5 or 10 minutes. But I think that it
would be better if I were to come back.</p>

<p>We will recess at this time until 2 p.m.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:45 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2><span class="smaller">Afternoon Session</span><br />
<span class="subhead">TESTIMONY OF ROBERT EDWARD LEE OSWALD RESUMED</span></h2>

<p>The President's Commission reconvened at 2:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will come to order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Returning to page 1 of your memorandum, as I recall your
recording of the events of that day, November 22, 1963, you first learned of
the assassination or attempted assassination as of that moment of President
Kennedy while you were at lunch with some fellow workers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you identify those fellow workers, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I <span class="locked">might&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I ask you to withdraw that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You don't like the expression "fellow workers"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You object to the whole question, or just the way it was
phrased?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Let's rephrase it, Mr. Dulles, if I may, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will yield to you, Mr. McKenzie. Fellow employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were at lunch with fellow employees of Acme Brick Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please identify those gentlemen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. They are Mr. Bill Darwin, the director of marketing of the
Acme Brick Co., Mr. Burnett Henry, director of plants and transportation of
the Acme Brick Co., Mr. Bob Oech, who is the Texas division plant manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of Acme Brick Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of Acme Brick Co.</p>

<p>And Mr. Bud Adams, who is the plant manager of both the old and new
Denton plants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was at this time and on this occasion at lunchtime that
you first heard any intimation or otherwise of the assassination or attempted
assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir. At the completion of our lunch, as we were departing
from the restaurant, as noted in my memorandum, page 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you speak on that page of driving in an automobile, either
all or some of you gentlemen.</p>

<p>Whose automobile was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. All of us were in one automobile, and we were in Mr. Burnett
Henry's automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it&mdash;did the automobile have a radio in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you gentlemen have the radio in operation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And listening to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you listening to anything in particular?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. We were listening to a newscast of the events that had already
taken place in Dallas, Tex., at approximately 12:30 that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you record the time in your notebook?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;as approximately 1 p.m., sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we had reached page 6 of your memorandum.</p>

<p>You record on pages 4 and 5&mdash;I think towards the bottom of page 4, and
the upper portion of page 5&mdash;your meeting that day or early evening with
Marina and, I believe your mother&mdash;but at least Marina.</p>

<p>Is that correct?</p>

<p>In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And just for the purpose of making sure of the record, I gather
from your testimony yesterday that this was the first time that you had seen
Marina since Thanksgiving Day of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did this visit take place&mdash;where did you meet her
on this occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Dallas police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she have either or both of her children with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. She had both of her children with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would include the infant Rachel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you advised at any time prior to this occasion that her
second child had been born to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was the first information you had on this subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You probably knew that a child was contemplated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he might not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I wasn't aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you even up to that moment been advised directly or
indirectly that Marina had been pregnant, from which pregnancy the child
Rachel had been born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not been advised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an interpreter present at the time you visited with
Marina; as I recall your mother was present, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an interpreter there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. There was a Mrs. Paine there, who was acting as an interpreter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now named everybody present&mdash;yourself, Marina, and
her two children, your mother, yourself, and Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. With the exception, sir, that there was a police officer, or my
assumption that he was a police officer, in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he in uniform or plain clothes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Plain clothes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Paine was not there at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He came later that day, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Just a very few minutes after this meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine then acted as interpreter between yourself and
Marina and between her and others in the party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything in the presence of everybody to her with
respect to the birth of her second child, which came as a complete surprise to
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If memory serves me correct, sir, I did make some type of statement
to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you express surprise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I feel certain that I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall now&mdash;you walked into the room, and there was
Marina with these others, but with two children, one an infant that you had
not seen before. Was it immediately explained to you? Did you inquire as to
the identity of the infant? Can you reconstruct that for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my remembrance on that, sir, possibly during the
preceding half hour, when I was talking with my mother, she possibly&mdash;this I
am not clear&mdash;advised me of the second child. If she did not, I was, of course,
much more surprised when I walked into the room where Marina was holding
the infant. I remember looking at the infant, as Marina held the infant, and
making some type of comment about whether or not it was a boy or girl and
how old it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't recall this recorded in your memorandum&mdash;and it may
very well be&mdash;that the preceding half hour you had had a meeting or conference
with your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that&mdash;in whose presence was that conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First in the presence of two or three FBI agents, and a Star
Telegram reporter, Fort Worth Star Telegram reporter, at the Dallas police
station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you record that event in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do, on page 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On page 6 there is a reference, I think I have interpreted your
writing, to a Mr. Cummings. Would you find that place on page 6?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do I interpret your writing correctly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct. I believe his name to be a Lieutenant Cummings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I sought. He was an officer of the Dallas police
force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I believe you record on page 6, that Mr. Cummings, Lieutenant
Cummings, or some other&mdash;well, I don't want to interpret what you do record&mdash;but
you received a report at that time, according to your memorandum, of the
fact of the arrest of your brother, Lee, in connection with the murder of Officer
Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the first information you had that your brother had
actually been arrested in connection with that incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When had you first received information in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. As my prior testimony stated, at the office, at the new Denton
plant, when Lee's name was first mentioned, stating that he had been arrested
in regards to the shooting to death of a police officer, and possibly the President
of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Page 7&mdash;did you, at the time of the events recorded on page 7, see or request
to see your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And of whom did you make that request?</p>

<p>First I would put it this way: Did you see Lee Harvey Oswald on that day
or evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did make a request? Of whom did you make that
request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To a police officer. I cannot recall his name. He reportedly
passed on my request to captain of police, Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was his response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The police officer who passed on my request asked that I stay
around, that Captain Fritz was quite busy, that he would see me later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you see Captain Fritz later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I did see him, but I did not talk to him. By this, I mean he
was in his glass office, within an office, and I did see him through the glass, but
I did not talk to Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the disposition of your&mdash;at least as of that day&mdash;of
your request to see your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not decided either way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I never did receive an answer either way, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>And you eventually left the police station, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You record on page 7 that you walked to your automobile, do you
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you trace your course from the time you left the
Dallas City police office to the time you retired that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. You are referring to the time that I first left the Dallas police
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes&mdash;start there, and trace your steps to the time you retired
for the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Well, my departure of the Dallas police office&mdash;I walked to my
car that was in a parking lot approximately seven blocks away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About what time of day or evening was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the best of my recollection, approximately 8 o'clock at night,
sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir. When you left the Dallas police office or station,
did you then have a definite route in mind as to where you were going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had no arrangements with anybody, and no one had any
with you, with respect to where you might or could go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Proceed, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On arrival at my car in the parking lot in Dallas, Tex., I started
to drive, I did drive to Fort Worth, Tex., by Highway 80.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then&mdash;you then had in mind doing what&mdash;returning
home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; that was not the direction of home, sir. I did not have
anything in mind other than I wanted to drive and to arrange my thoughts at
that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, you do say, and I quote from your memorandum, "I was attempting to
arrange my thoughts and my fears."</p>

<p>Do you find that expression on page 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please explain to the Commission what was
meant when you recorded the sentence, "I was attempting to arrange my thoughts
and my fears"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. What I meant by that statement, sir&mdash;not being disrespectful&mdash;I
believe it speaks for itself in view of the happenings of the day. To further
elaborate on that, I wanted to have some time by myself to think about the happenings
of the day and the arrest of my brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, and the
reference to my fears, whether or not he could have possibly done this. He
had been up to that time either accused or arrested for the death of Police
Officer J.&nbsp;D. Tippit, and the investigation that was now going on in Dallas as
to the death of the President of the United States and the wounding of Governor
Connally, of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You were then driving in your automobile.</p>

<p>Did you actually reach Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. After driving through Fort Worth, to the west side of Fort Worth,
I turned around and headed back toward Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Up to this point it was continuous driving, except as
you might have been resting or waiting a change of stoplight or something of
that character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anybody contact you, or did you speak with anybody during
the period of this drive up to the moment we now have reached?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir. You reversed your course and then where did
you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. When I reversed my course, I still did not have any idea as to
exactly where I was going. But I did reverse my course, and I started driving
on the turnpike between Fort Worth and Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that have a highway number?</p>

<p>I notice you mentioned a Highway 80.</p>

<p>Is that the same as the turnpike?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Highway 80 is on the old highway from Fort Worth to Dallas,
the turnpike being a later and more modern trafficway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And a toll road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And a toll road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you take Highway 80 in going to Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you returned by the toll road?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>I take it you continued your drive&mdash;continued to drive along, while you were
attempting to rearrange your thoughts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you eventually arrived where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At Dallas, Tex., sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become a guest of a hotel; did you register anywhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At the Statler Hilton Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, up to that moment, having in mind your route, had anybody
contacted you, had you spoken with anybody? Up to the time that you
entered the Statler Hilton Hotel to register?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had spoken to somebody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. A gas station attendant midway on the turnpike where I stopped
to buy gas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But other than that incident, you had no contact with anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You registered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go to your room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Approximately what time was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 10:30 p.m., that night, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After registering, did you retire for the evening, or did you go
somewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not retire for the evening. I did, in fact, go
into the coffee room of the Statler Hilton Hotel in Dallas, and have a ham
sandwich and some milk, and shortly after completing this, I walked across
the street, which was approximately a half a block down the street, to the
Dallas police station again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Now, up to that moment, other than was necessary for you to register and
your conversation with a waitress, in connection with your having some evening
lunch, did you have any contact with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any contact at all of any kind or character up
to this moment with anybody in connection with the events of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You went across the street to the Dallas City police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had an appointment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your purpose in going across the street for that visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I wanted to speak to Captain Fritz, if possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You record on page 8 that you entered the Dallas police station,
you were interviewed or consulted by some FBI agents in a small office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it in any event, however, that they questioned you, did
they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were all the answers that you gave the truth and nothing
but the truth to the best of your information, recollection, and belief, at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It most certainly was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>When did you learn, if you ever learned, that your brother, Lee Harvey
Oswald, had in fact been charged with the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. At approximately midnight or a few minutes before midnight,
November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that recorded on page 8 of your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your reaction when that information was conveyed
to you? What were your thoughts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not recall if I had any thoughts at that particular time,
sir. I did not make any comment that I recall. I believe I just shook my
head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask you in connection with page 8, your opinion
respecting the possible involvement of your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, in
the assassination of President Kennedy, but Mr. Dulles this morning in his
questions has covered that subject, so I will skip it.</p>

<p>Now, did you see Captain Fritz that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attempt to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire further with respect to an opportunity on
your part that you wished to see your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I had been told so many times that Captain Fritz
was quite busy, and I realize, of course, he was, and I let it go at that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, following your visit to the police station, which you do
record there, and therefore I won't go into it further, what did you do that
evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I returned to my hotel, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And retired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, between the time you left the Statler Hilton Hotel and
the time you returned there to retire, were you contacted by anybody or did
you have any conversation with anybody respecting the course of events of the
day, other than you have recorded in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
And I might add I did register under my regular name at the Statler Hilton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I didn't even think to ask you that, because I assumed it was so.</p>

<p>On page 9, you record and report the following morning an occasion when
you were in the barber shop of the Statler Hilton, obtaining a shave. Isn't that
correct, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you also record an observation by one or both of the barbers,
I think the gentleman who was shaving you, on the subject of your brother,
Lee Harvey Oswald deserved a fair trial like anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you end up that comment, "but I did leave my barber
a 50-cent tip."</p>

<p>That followed an observation on your part that you did not engage in that
conversation, and you merely listened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you indicate to me the significance if there is any
significance, of the expression "but I did leave my barber a 50-cent tip."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. The only significance, sir, that I put to it at that time was that
for the first time I was listening to somebody other than police officers and FBI
agents as to the past events of the preceding day, and I was more or less hearing
again for the first time a reaction, either&mdash;pro and con, to these two gentlemen's
opinions, who I would take at that time would be average people, as to whether
or not Lee did have a right to a fair trial, regardless of what he had done or
been accused of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do I take it a fair interpretation of your comment is that
you were pleased that average everyday people, that their reaction was that
your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, was entitled to, and they hoped he would obtain
a fair and impartial trial when put to trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your reference to a 50-cent tip was an emphasis in your own
mind of your pleasure that a spontaneous reaction of ordinary people was that
he was entitled to and they hoped he would receive a fair and impartial trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to page 10, please? You record events&mdash;you were
then in the district attorney's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You refer to a "H. Wade." Who is H. Wade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Mr. Henry Wade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what office did he hold?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Dallas District Attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I don't know as I interpret your handwriting clearly. It looks to me as though
you have written reference to a Jim Bowie. Who was Jim Bowie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. First assistant district attorney to Mr. Henry Wade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On page 10 you use&mdash;you make a reference to, or a comment
with regard to a conversation which I take it took place between you and Mr.
Wade and Mr. Bowie, either or both of them, which was "not too informative."
Do you find that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I do see the section that you are referring to&mdash;if I may
elaborate on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to have you elaborate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "Not too informative on either side."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either side of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Referring to the district attorney's office as one side and my side
as the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what issue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Of the conversations that we had in reference to the legal standing
of Lee Harvey Oswald or to his guilt, of the accusations that had been&mdash;that
he had been charged with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you turn to page 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner.</span> There is a reference there to a conversation as to whether Lee
Harvey Oswald would say anything to you when and if you interviewed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you have in mind as to the subject matter about which
Lee Harvey Oswald might speak with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To the amount of involvement, if any, with relation to the death
of the President of the United States on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then contemplating your prospective conversation with
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you use an expression also there that you would do your
best. Do you find that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you would do your best to do what, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To find out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. From Lee Harvey Oswald, during our conversation or <span class="locked">our&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your prospective interview?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Our prospective interview, whether or not he did in fact perform
the acts, either alone or with other people, that he had been accused of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Now, following that conversation that you do record on that page, did you see
your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Dallas police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you describe the surroundings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was taken up on the elevator by a Dallas police officer&mdash;Mr.
Tom Kelley, inspector from Washington, D.C., U.S. Secret Service joined us, and
one agent, Mr. Mike Howard. On arrival to the floor where Lee was being held,
the police officer passed through a glass slot in the window to another police
officer the pass, I believe signed by Captain Fritz, which authorization was for
me to see Lee Harvey Oswald. Two or three minutes went by, and I was
advised that he was now ready to see me, and I was taken to a small room
to the left of the elevators on this floor, and no one else was in this room on his
side, or my side of the glass partitions that separated the locked side from the
unlocked side.</p>

<p>And Lee was standing there before me on the other side of the glass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you have the impression that the officers had told your
brother that you were the one who was coming to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Because you just said that the officer said he was ready to see
you, and I gained the impression from <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;whether or not I meant by that that&mdash;I do not believe
that was my full meaning on that statement, because I was not aware that
they had actually told Lee that it was me he was about to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you converse with your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By what means?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By telephone, while looking at him through the glass partition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How far apart were you, roughly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Just a matter of inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you in that room, conversing with your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Approximately 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as near as you can recall, what did he say to you and
what did you say to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do recall to the best of my ability his first statement to me was
"How are you?"</p>

<p>My reply was "I am fine."</p>

<p>I asked him how he was&mdash;as I observed the cuts and bruises on his face.
He said he was just fine, and that they were treating him okay. I believe his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
next statement was at this time "I cannot or would not say anything because
the line is apparently tapped."</p>

<p>I did not comment on that, and he rather carried the conversation for 2 or 3
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you repeat it to us as best you can recall it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, I do not recall this particular part of the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just do your best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am sorry, sir, I just cannot recall that particular part of the
conversation. I might comment on that particular part to this extent. That
I felt that it was rather a mechanical conversation from his standpoint.
He seemed to be speaking very fast, and there was approximately 2 or 3 minutes
of him speaking in this nature. Then I took the initiative and started speaking
to him about the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. About the family, including his family, my family. And, also,
at this time, when we talked about his family in particular&mdash;I believe my
question to him was "What about Marina and the children?"</p>

<p>His reply to me at that time was "Don't worry about them. The Paines
will take care of them"&mdash;that his friends, the Paines, would take care of them
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Lee's friends, the Paines, would take care of them satisfactorily?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>My reply to him on that was what he considered to be his friends were not
mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he respond to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my recollection, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were you the first member of the family to see him, or had
Marina seen him the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Both Marina and Marguerite had seen him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Earlier that afternoon, sir. I was the last member of the
family to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything about the new child, Rachel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you raise that, or did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I simply stated that I had seen the new baby and was not
aware of it at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not aware that the baby had been born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he respond to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He smiled and stated he had hoped for a boy rather than a
girl. His further comment was, "Well, you know how that goes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He said nothing, I take it, then, by way of apology or otherwise
that you had not theretofore been informed of the birth of this child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You record on page 13 of your memorandum&mdash;you use this expression:
"I was not talking to the Lee I knew."</p>

<p>Do you find that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you read that full sentence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "He talked about the Paines as his friends and that they would
take care of Marina and the children."</p>

<p>Excuse me&mdash;I started too soon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. "I stated who he considered to be his friends were not necessarily
mine. I did this to try to get through to him. To me his answers were
mechanical and I was not talking to the Lee I knew."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you able to get through to him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
Did you feel you got through to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you elaborate, please, on your expression "I was not
talking to the Lee I knew"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was referring more specifically to the first part of our conversation,
where his conversation seemed to me, as previously stated, very
mechanical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had the feeling he was not exposing himself fully to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this the last time you ever saw your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Alive, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On page 14 you record a later conversation after you had left
your brother&mdash;you have an expression there along the lines that you agreed
with someone that if the conversation had been person to person, that things
might have been different. Do you find that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please elaborate on what you meant by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. By "we" in that paragraph, sir, on page 14, I am talking about
Mr. Tom Kelley, Inspector from Washington, D.C., United States Secret Service,
and agent, Mr. Mike Howard.</p>

<p>Our discussion was of the nature&mdash;I related to them as best I could remember
my entire conversation with Lee Harvey Oswald on that afternoon of November
23, 1963, and I was of the opinion, or perhaps expressed, either by Mr.
Kelley or Mr. Mike Howard, that had we been placed in a room facing each other,
perhaps more could have been learned or something could have been learned
about whether or not he was actually guilty or how much he was involved in the
assassination of the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could I elaborate on that? If you talked person to person to
him in a room, in which there was assurance there was no bugging, nobody
listening to your conversation, that you might have been able to obtain more
information from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a fair summary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you wish him to elaborate or expand or amend that, Mr.
McKenzie, it is perfectly all right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No&mdash;that is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does Mr. Oswald wish to elaborate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have concluded my examination.</p>

<p>On behalf of myself and the staff, I express to Mr. Oswald and to Mr.
McKenzie our appreciation for the splendid cooperation that we have received,
and the frank and direct answers that the witness has given to all of the questions
I have put to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I am very glad that was put on the record. I entirely share it
for the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. If I could, possibly, sir, at this <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you like to add anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I would like to make one little statement in regard to my memorandum,
on page 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. In relation or reference to my intentions at that time, as it is
now, as recorded on page 12, "Intentions then as now was to find out the truth
and nothing else."</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>I have one question, only one.</p>

<p>You testified, I believe, yesterday that when you met your brother at the airport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
upon his return from the Soviet Union, that he seemed somewhat disappointed
that the press was not there to meet him and talk with him.</p>

<p>Do you recall, in your relations with your brother, any other instances where
he appeared to desire publicity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; it is my opinion that that was the only time that I felt
like possibly he did want publicity. At later dates, at my home, in Fort Worth,
Tex., where they stayed, on quite a few occasions, either by telephone call or
the newspaper reporter actually coming to my home, he stated he did not want to
speak to him, and he did not want to see them, and they did not, sir, while he
was in the presence of my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I ask one further thing?</p>

<p>What is your religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I was raised in the Lutheran religion, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were all three of you boys so reared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you steady churchgoers? Or were you churchgoers at
all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have nothing further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I want to join Mr. Jenner in expressing to you and your counsel,
Mr. McKenzie, our thanks for your full and I believe frank testimony. I think
you have been very helpful to us. I wish to thank you for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Thank you, sir. And we hope that we have been of some help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that statement, and likewise,
Mr. Jenner, I appreciate on behalf of myself and Mr. Oswald your statement for
the record.</p>

<p>I only have a few brief questions, Mr. Chairman, if I may, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These are to be put to your client?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir. Although I will say this at this time&mdash;that the Chair
has very generously, and Mr. Jenner likewise, granted me the opportunity to
question or ask Mr. Oswald questions as we proceeded along.</p>

<p>Robert, there is a contract which has been introduced into the record, and I
believe it is Commission Exhibit No. 277, which contract is dated December 9,
1963, and it is signed by Marina N. Oswald and yourself, and approved as to form
by John M. Thorne, Attorney, and James H. Martin. In this contract, it provides
that Marina Oswald has appointed you as an assistant business manager to
Mr. Martin. And in the last paragraph of the contract there is a statement to the
effect that she has employed the firm of Thorne and Leach, attorneys-at-law, and
further agreed that their services will be available at all times to yourself and
that you will use same as required by you.</p>

<p>Now, my question to you is this: Have you ever at any time employed Mr.
John M. Thorne to represent you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Has Mr. Thorne ever represented you in any capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he has not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I just ask one question?</p>

<p>Mr. McKenzie now is your appointed lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He is my selected lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Did Lee Harvey Oswald ever tell you or advise you, or has
Marina N. Oswald told you of any trips that Lee took, or cities that he visited
in Russia, other than Moscow, Minsk, or the hunting trip he took while he was
in Russia reported in your diary? Or reported not in your diary, but reported in
the letters to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you know of any cities or any places that he might have
gone in Russia, other than the two cities that I have named, and the hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
trip that he took as reported in the letter to you, which has been introduced into
evidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I am not aware of any other cities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Did Marina N. Oswald have either June Oswald, her two-year-old
child, or Rachel, her infant child, baptized, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And where was that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is my understanding that this took place in Dallas, Tex., some
time in the year of 1963, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You are speaking now of June?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am speaking now of June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Has the baby Rachel been baptized as of this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not to my knowledge, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you know what faith June was baptized in? By faith I
refer to what particular church or denomination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe, sir, this was the Greek Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. From your acquaintance with Marina Oswald, and based on
your discussions with her, both in your home and elsewhere, including cemetery
visits which you have made with her, do you now consider and believe that
Marina N. Oswald is a Christian and believes in the teachings of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Has she professed such faith to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Not directly, sir&mdash;only by implication, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you believe or have you formed an opinion now, based on
your discussions and observations of Marina Oswald, as to whether or not Marina
N. Oswald is a Communist or a Soviet agent, either now or at any time since you
met her at Dallas, Love Field, in June of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not believe that she is any of those things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now, do you think she is a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you have any opinion as to whether or not she is at this
time or since she arrived in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I am of the opinion that she is not, based on my observations of
her reactions and her conversations with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Oswald, have I or has anyone at any time coached or
briefed you&mdash;and if you don't understand what I mean by the word "coached"
please tell me so&mdash;as to what you should testify here before this Commission,
other than my cautioning you not to speculate or use conjecture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; you have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Has anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; they have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Have you told the <span class="locked">Commission&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me&mdash;that anyone includes any member of the staff of this
Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And likewise it includes, does it not, any member of the FBI,
or the Secret Service or any other Federal agency?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And the same would apply to any State agency of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Sir, that would apply to anybody, no matter what his position
with any government agency or individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now, have you told the Commission during the hearings here,
since you have been testifying, only the facts as you knew them, or the facts
as you know them now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And have you expressed opinions or speculated only when the
Commission or Mr. Jenner or myself have asked you to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Have you testified, Mr. Oswald, truthfully to the best of your
recollection in each instance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald.</span> Yes, sir, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And in the event you have inadvertently made any mistake on
dates, addresses, or facts, do you now ask the Chairman's permission to change
your answer and correct any mistakes which you might have made in the event
a mistake is at any time hereafter called to your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Well, could I supplement that? In the event that you, yourself,
find any mistakes&mdash;I think you said if it was called to his <span class="locked">attention&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir, I certainly will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I just add here&mdash;I hope that that will be looked over, the
record will be looked over fairly promptly, so that we can make any corrections
within a reasonable length of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir; as soon as we receive it, Mr. Chairman, we will do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I say in that connection, Mr. McKenzie, if you could have
him dictate that tape covering his memorandum, we can perhaps actually incorporate
that in the record, which you will receive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. We cannot do it today, because we won't get to Dallas until
late this evening. And I am going to church tomorrow and teach Sunday school
and be with my children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. And I with mine, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I will make arrangements the first of the week to have it done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Send it to Mr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I shall.</p>

<p>If you receive from any source any further documentary information or any
type of information which might be considered as evidence by this Commission,
do you now ask the Commission's approval and permission to deliver such documents
or information, if any, to the FBI, so that the information may be immediately
forwarded to the Commission to assist in preparing its final report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Jenner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Likewise, do you authorize me to deliver any like information
or documents which I may receive, discover or otherwise have in my possession
to the same agencies for the same purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I most certainly do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here, again, Mr. McKenzie, if anything is delivered, would you
have it delivered to Mr. Rankin, rather than to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Have you ever applied for relief, unemployment compensation, or any other
form of welfare aid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And I refer there, sir, to both the Federal Government aid
programs and likewise any aid program of the State of Texas or the State of
Louisiana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct&mdash;or any other State of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I believe that you have previously testified to this, but I want
to make it absolutely clear.</p>

<p>Do you now believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was at any time an agent of any
agency of the United States Government, from the time that he departed for
Russia, until the day of his death on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I do not believe that he was an agent of any government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Prior to November 22, 1963, did you know of any activities
of Lee Harvey Oswald relative to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee or his
arrest in New Orleans, La.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Oswald, what has been your position insofar as the press
is concerned, since the unfortunate and tragic happenings of November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. My position with any news media, whether it be the newspapers,
magazines, television, et cetera, has been that&mdash;no comment, and the only comment
I ever made to any of them, at a very early date, was that I would abide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
by the decision of the Commission which is now known as the Warren
Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Have you ever sought to elaborate or give any statement to
the press at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you recall any statements made by Marina N. Oswald
expressing sympathy for President's family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And if you will, state the source of your recollection and
where the statement was made, and if she has ever made any statement to that
effect to yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; she did make a statement directly to myself. To the
best of my recollection, this was first done on Monday, November 25, 1963, at
the Inn of the Six Flags, at Arlington, Tex., as Marina and myself observed the
beginning of the funeral for the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And was there anyone else present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; there were other people in the room. Whether or not
they overheard our conversation, I do not know, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You observed that on television, I gather?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Were there any Secret Service agents there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Were they in the room with you and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And did they overhear any expressions of sympathy which
she might have said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. It is possible that they did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Have you ever testified in a lawsuit or given a deposition
before a court reporter prior to your appearance before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now, you have testified that you have not given any statements
to the press other than the statement to the effect that you would abide
with and be satisfied with the report of this Commission.</p>

<p>Since arriving in Washington, and since you have been sworn under oath before
the Commission, have you given any statement to the press, other than saying
goodnight, or good afternoon, or good morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe at one time I did say thank you. Other than that, sir,
I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now, have you read an article here in the New York Times
of Saturday, February 22, 1964, on page 22 of the first section, entitled, "Russian
training of Oswald hinted"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Do you know Mr. Anthony Lewis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Have you ever talked with Mr. Lewis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Now, you have testified this afternoon following our lunch
break that you visited Lee Oswald in the Dallas County Jail. Do you recall
that testimony&mdash;the testimony of just a few minutes ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Have you previously testified to that before the Commission,
to your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To my recollection, I believe we at least touched on that during
our first session on February 20, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. When you were in the jail&mdash;and I believe it is in the sixth
floor of the Dallas County Jail&mdash;I mean the Dallas City Jail&mdash;talking with your
brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, did you ask him at that time if he had committed
the crime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. You did ask him that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And what did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I put it to him as stated in my diary, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Identify the page, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. On page 12, "I do not recall everything he said. I did try to
point out to him that the evidence was overwhelming that he did kill Police
Officer Tippit and possibly the President. To this he replied 'do not form any
opinion on the so-called evidence.'"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that all he said? He said nothing else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. To <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In response to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At no time when you interviewed him over the telephone while
you were in that&mdash;the sixth floor&mdash;did he affirmatively deny either that he
had shot Officer Tippit or that he shot the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He did not admit to anything whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nor did he deny it affirmatively&mdash;other than the remark that
you have recorded in your memorandum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. In other words, Mr. Oswald, when you were talking there
with your brother, in the city jail of Dallas, he did not deny that he had killed
Officer Tippit, nor did he deny that he had assassinated President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. He did not admit to anything, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. And he didn't deny anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Have you, or haven't you told this Commission that you believed
a denial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mr. McKenzie, I don't understand that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. It says in this article that he told the Commission that he
believed the denial.</p>

<p>Since there was no denial, there was nothing for you to believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to this moment he has never testified as to that, to my
recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Again, based on the evidence that you have read or heard in newspaper
articles, whether it be evidence or not, but based on everything that you have
heard or read, you now believe that your brother, Lee Harvey Oswald, did kill
Mr. Tippit and assassinated President Kennedy, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Purely on the circumstantial evidence that has been brought
to my attention or that I have read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. I believe that is all, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I ask one question?</p>

<p>Mr. Oswald, until this afternoon, when you recalled orally here the circumstances
and the event of your discussion with your brother on the sixth floor
of the Dallas&mdash;is that Dallas County?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. No; it is Dallas City Jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dallas City Jail&mdash;had I had any conversation with you at all
on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. None that I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. That is all, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That will then conclude the testimony of Mr. Robert Oswald,
with the understanding that the Commission might later wish to recall him
if any facts are adduced that would make that desirable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Mr. Dulles&mdash;is he now released from his oath to the Commission,
subject to recall and being resworn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct. That is my understanding.</p>

<p>In any event, I so agree, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenzie</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>I would like to state to the Commission one further thing, Mr. Dulles, if I may.
We very much appreciate, and by "we" I mean myself as counsel, and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
Oswald as a witness, the manner in which the Commission and its counsel
have conducted the interrogation of Mr. Oswald. We further appreciate the
opportunity to be in Washington and to be heard, and hope that in some
manner that we may assist in shedding some light that will assist this Commission
in making its final report, and that the true facts of this situation will be
known to the President of the United States to use at his discretion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. McKenzie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I ask one more question?</p>

<p>Up until this afternoon when I questioned you, possibly there might have
been a question this morning on the subject of any opinion which you might
have held dealing with whether your brother did or did not participate in the
shooting of Officer Tippit or the assassination of President Kennedy, had I had
any conversation with you on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; I believe you had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. I believe this was on the first session, during the first session
on Wednesday, February 20, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it in this room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all I meant. I had no separate&mdash;no conversation with
you on the subject other than as I might have put a question to you in the
presence of the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Oswald</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And a part of the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as part of the record; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will adjourn.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 3:40 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Leech, I understand you are a partner of Mr. Thorne
who was here representing Mrs. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Gentlemen, I will just read an opening statement to you that
we make for the record and for the benefit of the witness each time we convene.</p>

<p>On November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order
No. 11130 appointing a Commission "to ascertain, evaluate and report upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
facts relating to the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy, and
the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination."</p>

<p>On December 13, 1963, Congress adopted Joint Resolution S.J. 137 which
authorizes the Commission, or any member of the Commission, or any agent
or agency designated by the Commission for such purpose, to administer oaths
and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.</p>

<p>On January 21, 1964, the Commission adopted a resolution authorizing each

<p>On January 21, 1964, the Commission adopted a resolution authorizing each
member of the Commission and its General Counsel, J. Lee Rankin, to administer
oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence concerning
any matter under investigation by the Commission.</p>

<p>The purpose of this hearing is to take the testimony of Mr. James Herbert
Martin who has acted as the business manager of Mrs. Marina Oswald, the
widow of Lee Harvey Oswald, who, prior to his death, was charged with the
assassination of President Kennedy. In view of Mr. Martin's close association
with Mrs. Oswald it is the intention of this Commission to ask Mr. Martin
questions concerning this association and any and all matters related to the
assassination, and to the subsequent killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin has been furnished with a copy of this statement and a copy of
the rules adopted by the Commission for the taking of testimony or the production
of evidence. Mr. Martin has also been furnished with a copy of Executive
Order No. 11130 and Congressional Resolution S.J. Res. 137 which set forth
the general scope of the Commission's inquiry and its authority for the examining
of witnesses and the receiving of evidence.</p>

<p>I should also like to read into the record at this time a copy of a letter dated
February 22, 1964, to Mr. Martin from Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of
the Commission, which reads as follows:</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Martin:</p>

Avenue, NE., Washington, D.C., for the purpose of giving sworn testimony concerning

<p>I assume, gentlemen, you did receive a copy of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech.</span> Yes, we did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chairman</span>. I will not be able to be here at all times today because we
have, we are hearing arguments in the Court at 10 o'clock and I must leave to
be there, but Mr. Dulles anticipates being here all day so in my absence he will
conduct hearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
Congressman Ford has some unfinished business at the Congress as I have at
the Court so he probably will not be here all through the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, will you please rise and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear in this proceeding before the Commission to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

to act in order to protect or advise the Commission as to any interests of Lee H.
Oswald because of&mdash;you probably saw the notice in the paper and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. You represent the man from Arizona?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long have you lived there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Since 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Hotel executive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you now connected with the Six Flags Motel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you at one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And during what period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. From May of 1962 until January 1, 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was your position with that institution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Resident manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. While you were at the Six Flags Inn, did you become acquainted
with Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About when was the first time that you met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I guess it was November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And will you tell us how that acquaintance started?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I was called by the Tarrant County sheriff on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Lew Evans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About 11 o'clock in the morning, and they wanted a room where
they could question the Oswald family. I told them they could have it, and
about four o'clock, I guess, four or four-thirty, I don't know the exact time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
came in with the whole family, and we gave them several rooms to accommodate
the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you introduced to Marina Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I don't believe I was ever really introduced to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you come to know her then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, just through association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I see. Did you know the county sheriff before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Vaguely, not to any great extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know of any particular reason why he chose your
establishment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Because of the central location between Dallas and Fort Worth
and the isolation of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At that time who came to stay with you at the Six Flags Inn,
Marina and some of her family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, Marina and the two children and Robert and Marguerite
Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they have several suites there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. They had one room, well, one suite, room 423 and 424 and then
we gave them two other rooms for the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anyone make arrangements with you besides the county
sheriff about how this would be handled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who, for the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, Charles Kunkel, and Howard&mdash;I can't remember his
first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was this arrangement made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, down in the room in the suite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. There at the Six Flags Inn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the three of you were there together, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, there were also Arlington police officers and several other
Secret Service men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who participated in the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I don't know who else was in the conversation. It was
primarily between Kunkel and Howard and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was said in regard to this arrangement at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, they said that they would need these rooms to accommodate
the family and they had no idea how long they would need it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anything said about the price and who would make payment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. They said that the Government would take care of the room
rate on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you have to submit this matter to any of your superiors
or did you make the decision at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I made the decision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you had any prior dealings with the Secret Service people
before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How long did Marguerite Oswald stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe she left on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Or maybe Thursday. Would be the 28th or 29th, I am not certain
as to the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any incidents where Marguerite Oswald sought
to leave prior to the Thursday or Friday that she left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't recall anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Have you ever assisted the local police officers in any other way
at your Six Flags Inn before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In a general way what was the nature of that assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, of course, I can't recall any specific instances. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
we cooperate with the law enforcement officers in anything they have to ask
us, and we cooperate with them, giving them information. I don't know of any
particular incidents other <span class="locked">than&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Would you describe briefly just where these rooms were in your
Inn and where the Secret Service were compared with Marina Oswald's rooms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, Marina Oswald was in Rooms 423 and 424, which were
connecting rooms, and the rooms faced away from the entrance to the motel.
And then the Secret Service had 422 and 421 also. They were rooms next door
to it, but not connecting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After Marina first came there did the Secret Service have someone
on duty while she was at the Six Flags?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall who that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see&mdash;well, I remember his first name now, Mike Howard,
and Charles Kunkel, Lee Gopadze was there part of the time. They seemed to
change quite frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did they have someone there 24 hours of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. During this early period did you ever talk to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, except to say hello.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know whether she talked English much at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. From all appearances, she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did anyone visit you while she was there at the Six Flags
during this early period that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge other than the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you invite Marina and her family to come to your home for
Thanksgiving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us how that happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it just happened. I don't know, I think I asked Robert if
he would like to come out for dinner, Thanksgiving dinner. They weren't going
to have a very happy Thanksgiving, and living in those rooms was pretty
cramped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was this that you asked Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you include Robert and his wife as well as Marina and her
family in the invitation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, Robert's wife wasn't there, but I included Robert. He
came out to the house also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Marina then come to your house for Thanksgiving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who all came at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, there were Marina and June Lee, and Robert, Charlie
Kunkel, and one Arlington police officer. I don't recall his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What time of the day did they come?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe it was 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you invite Marguerite Oswald to Thanksgiving dinner
at that time, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. As I recall I just asked, I believe I just asked Robert if
they would like to come, they were welcome if they would like to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean by that that you included Marguerite Oswald in
your invitation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't think I named her. I don't know if she had left
by then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You didn't deliberately exclude her from the invitation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Then did you at some time discuss with Marina the possibility
of her staying at your home rather than at the Six Flags Inn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I discussed it with Secret Service first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Thursday or Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before this Thanksgiving dinner or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't recall. I know the Secret Service made a statement
that they were quite concerned as to where Marina would go after she left the
Inn. They had no place to put her and they had no idea where she was
going to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall when they made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, it was Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At that time did you say anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I told them that if they couldn't find any place for her that
I would be glad to take them into my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anything said about what compensation you would
receive for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. There was no compensation considered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You didn't suggest any and they didn't, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss that idea with Marina at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. They, the Secret Service told Robert about it, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Because he told me they had. And then Robert thanked me
and said that it would work out all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Before you made that suggestion had you had any discussions
about selling any rights to Marina's stories or anything of that character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. With any media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you happen to make this offer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I felt sorry for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you limit the offer to Marina and her children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any talk at that time about Robert living at
your home, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anything about Marguerite living there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss this proposal with your wife before you
made it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you describe for the Commission briefly your home,
how the layout of it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it is a three-bedroom house, with a living room, dining
room, den and kitchen, two baths.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. All of it on the same floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you give us an idea of where the bedrooms were from
the rest of the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, as you come in the front door you go through one
end of the living room, and then into a hallway, and the bedrooms are along
the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And is yours and Mrs. Martin's bedroom at the end of
the hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Does it have a private bath associated with that suite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And all of the rooms of the house are on one floor, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then where was Marina's bedroom from yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The next room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And where was the bath that she used?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Right across the hall from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then after Marina's room right next to hers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Is a children's bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That was the closest one to the living room, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About how large was your bedroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think it is about 14 by, maybe 14 by 14, 16.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How large was Marina's room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About 11 by 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the children's room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About the same size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What children do you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have a 14-year-old boy and a 12-year-old boy and a 6-year-old
girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And they are all living at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And they have been throughout this period, have they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you discussed the assassination with Marina at all prior
to the time she came to live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you discussed any financial arrangements with her or the
idea that you should manage her affairs before she came to live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did the donations for Marina and her children start to
come in, do you recall the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was it before she came to live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge, I didn't&mdash;I think it started after she came
into the house.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Mr. Rankin, if you will excuse me now, gentlemen, I am going
to retire to my Court work and Mr. Dulles, will you conduct the hearing? If
you are still in session I will be here this afternoon to see you, if not, gentlemen,
I am very glad to have seen you, both of you. Give Mr. Thorne my regards,
please.</p>

<p>(At this point, the Chief Justice Warren left the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Will you proceed, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did the idea of your being Marina's business manager
first come up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was after the first of December. She had been there about
3 or 4 days, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us how it came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. One of the Secret Service agents suggested that I get an attorney
for Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Lee Gopadze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did this conversation occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. In the den.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think Marina was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. About what time of the day, do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Gopadze made this suggestion, he made it to you, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say that in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you know whether Marina understood it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, he had discussed it with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, he was talking about it to her about something in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then he turned to you, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about who you should get as a lawyer
for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I told him I would be happy to get one for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. John Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did you happen to select John Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I had known him from association at the Inn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had he ever acted as your attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was the nature of your acquaintance with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Just a passing acquaintance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss with Marina the qualifications of this attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything about it to Mr. Gopadze?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I, like I probably mentioned, John had handled some movie
work and he would probably know something about the area in which we were
talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you had made the suggestion of Mr. Thorne as a lawyer
did you do anything about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I called Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He came over, I believe, the next day and talked to Marina and
Lee Gopadze and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did he talk to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, through Lee Gopadze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. As an interpreter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As an interpreter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Gopadze is fluent in both Russian and English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Could you tell what Mr. Gopadze said to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss the nature of this retainer with Mr. Thorne at
that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't understand the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss what he would be doing if he was employed as
her lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Handling all her legal work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you tell him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And did you say anything about what the legal work would
involve, the kind of work it would be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't believe so at the time. I may have mentioned something
about her story or something like that. I don't recall the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anything said about the donations at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you discuss what he would be paid by way of compensation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not at that time. It was later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anything said by you or Mr. Thorne about his qualifications
to act as her attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were formal arrangements made about the employment of Mr.
Thorne as counsel for Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe that was December 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall anything else that was said or done at this conversation
when Mr. Thorne came over and talked to Marina through the interpreter
and you were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there a formal contract executed between Marina and Mr.
Thorne at some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that was December 6 to your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Either the 5th or the 6th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, before that contract was executed did you discuss it with
Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was Marina present when you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where did this discussion occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe it was at the Inn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Your office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, in the coffee shoppe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who else was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you then go over the terms of the contract with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I think I left that up to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you then the manager of Marina's affairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who were you acting for in regard to that arrangement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, acting for Marina although I had no&mdash;I had no contract
to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You were still acting under this suggestion by Mr. Gopadze
that some counsel be gotten for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you did go over the terms of this contract at that time,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you make any suggestions for changes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That we delete it, on my contract, we deleted any gifts or
contributions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That is on the draft of the contract for you to act as manager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And when did that idea of your acting as manager come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I believe it was the same day that John Thorne came
out to talk to Marina and to Gopadze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know who brought it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you suggest that you act as manager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't believe I suggested it. We were discussing the need
for a manager, and I don't know who brought it up as far as my being the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At that time was there any discussion about what compensation
you would have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When you were talking to Mr. Thorne in the coffee shoppe was
there a discussion about how much compensation he would receive for acting
as attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What was said about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, just that it would be 10 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Had you ever discussed that before with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>(At this point, Senator Cooper entered the hearing room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Senator, we welcome you.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you proceed? Would you just resume for a moment
where we are in the proceedings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. We are discussing the contract between Mr. Martin and Marina
and also how Mr. Thorne became counsel under the contracts that were made.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This 10-percent figure for John Thorne and the contract with
regard to his appointment then was his suggestion so far as you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As far as I know. I think we had discussed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You had discussed it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know exactly how we came to these figures as far as
that is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you think you had discussed it before the meeting at the
coffee shoppe that you described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Probably so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you suggest the amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You don't recall whether you did or he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you talk that over with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe Lee Gopadze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, there were several times we discussed it with Marina.
One time Robert was there. He read the contracts. Let's see, he usually came
in on Sunday so he read the contracts more at length.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Robert come in before or after your conversation in the
coffee shoppe that you referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. After you had the conversation in the coffee shoppe with Mr.
Thorne, did you make any changes in the draft of the contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Excuse me, what contract are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thorne contract.</p>

<p>Were you referring to the Thorne contract?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What changes did you make at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. We deleted gifts, contributions. He used a standard contractual
form, and in that contractual form it includes gifts and contributions, and we
deleted those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I hand you Exhibit No. 279 and ask you if that is a photostat
copy of the contract you have been referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And it has stricken out the words that you have just described
with regard to donations and gifts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It does give him an interest in collections, trust funds and
bequests, according to the language of this Exhibit No. 279.</p>

<p>Do you know what was meant by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. That was in the standard contract that this was drawn
from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever discuss this contract, Exhibit No. 279, with Marina
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, with Mr. Thorne and Robert Oswald present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Between the 1st and the 6th of December 1963. I can't recall
the dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you remember where you were when you had that discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At the house, my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to Marina about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't recall any conversation at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was anything said about the 10 percent at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she knew it was 10 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know she knew that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, we explained it to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who explained it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know whether I did or whether John Thorne did or
Robert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she understand English enough to understand what you
were talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Because of her reaction to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she react about the 10 percent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I mean there was no reaction as far as her, a definite
reaction but I could tell she understood it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what you observed about her that caused you
to think that she understood it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I don't know. I think it was explained to her as 10
cents of a dollar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was <span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. But she said she understood percents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did she say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That way. "I understand percents" or something of that type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any discussion with Marina about the effect of this
contract on donations and contributions from the public?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. We said that that would not be included in that 10 percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to Marina about whether this was a good
contract for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I probably did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You have no recollection about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. Actually we left most of it up to Robert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So whatever explanation was made to Marina was really made
by Robert, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Excuse me for just a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Mr. Martin's contract and Robert had a contract with her, too,
and Mr. Thorne's contract were left with her. They were not signed that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You tell us what you know about that, Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, Robert wanted to read over the contracts and think them
over, and I believe he took copies of them. Now, I am not sure, I am not certain,
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did Robert get involved here, of getting a share?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. From the beginning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were you present when that matter came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. That was Marina's request that he participate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When was that request made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Prior to the signing of the contracts, probably December 4&mdash;3d
or 4th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Who was present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe John Thorne and Robert, Marina and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did Marina say about that at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She wanted Robert to have some of the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did Robert say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As I recall he didn't say much of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything to indicate that he thought that was a
good idea, a bad idea?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I think he said, "Thank you," that is about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Marina say anything about how much she wanted Robert
to get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did she say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Ten percent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. She just said 10 percent, is that all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Marina make any explanation of how she decided that
Robert should get a share, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, other than she wanted to give Robert something.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was there any discussion at any time, Mr. Martin, as
to whether Marguerite should have any benefits from it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did Marina discuss with you at that time what Robert was to
do for his 10 percent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any discussion about what you were to do for
your share?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, to sell her story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And what would Mr. Thorne do for his 10 percent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Handle all the legal work involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ever hear any discussion about what Robert was to do
for his percentage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. We said that&mdash;let's see&mdash;we would discuss with him on various
occasions any of these contracts, but that he was&mdash;he would take over the
handling of Marina's affairs in case of my disability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anything more said than you have related about
what Robert would do for his share?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I think I probably remarked to him that there would
probably be plenty for him to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there any dispute between any of you or with Marina at
this time about the percentages?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. The only thing that I recall was the terms of the contract,
of my contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was something said about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Was 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And Marina thought that was too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did she say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said she thought 10 years was too long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, she wanted a 1 year contract and I told her that actually
1 year, there is no telling how this story would develop or anything, and
that 1 year might interfere with the sale of the story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did she say to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That they agreed to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. She agreed then to the 10 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was any interpreter present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. So whatever Marina understood about was from her understanding
of English and communication with you and Robert and Mr. Thorne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, Lee Gopadze had discussed it prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. He just discussed it, the general terms, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of course. I couldn't understand what he was saying. We left
the contracts with her for several days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. But you don't know what was done with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Because you weren't present.</p>

<p>Do you know whether she understood English enough to read those contracts
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She couldn't have read the contracts at that time. But
she said she understood it sufficiently, and that she would trust Robert's judgment
on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did she say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Just before&mdash;I guess the same day she signed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. I will ask you to look at Exhibit No. 279 and tell us whether
you recognize the signatures on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Whose signatures are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Mrs. Marina N. Oswald and James H. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. In the parts that are stricken <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. John M. Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. On Exhibit No. 279 were those stricken out before the discussion
of the contract?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that done when you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you observe the signing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. They were not signed the date it says they were signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. On the 5th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. The date it says they were signed that is the date they were
drawn up but they were all signed the same time, weren't they, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Can you tell us what the facts are in that regard, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The contracts were drawn&mdash;let's see&mdash;the contracts were drawn
and Robert wanted to go over them, so we held it in abeyance. I think he was
there on a Sunday and he came back on a Tuesday, I am not sure about the
days, and signed the contracts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you know the signature of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us whether or not Exhibit No. 279 bears her
signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. It appears to be witnessed by you, is that your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And the acceptance at the bottom of Exhibit No. 279, do you
know whose signature that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. John Thorne's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. And you say that the exhibit was, the contract, Exhibit No. 279
was executed on the 6th rather than the 5th day of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I can't recall the dates on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Excuse me for just a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Counsel, for what it is worth, Robert's was executed at the same
time as the other ones. I believe his is dated the 9th, isn't it? So it would have
been the 9th or afterwards. They were all executed at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Martin, do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I know they were all executed the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Whether or not it was the 9th or the 6th you don't recall at
this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I am fairly certain it was not the 6th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Are you certain what date it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What is your best recollection in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it was several days after the contracts were drawn that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
they were executed, and I believe the contracts were drawn, and the date that
they were drawn was entered on the contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You think that might have been December 5 that they were
drawn then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Chairman, that is already in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It has already been admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Rankin, we would like to have a short adjournment at 10:30.
The members of the Commission would like to speak with you.</p>

<p>(Short recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Commission will resume. Mr. Rankin, will you please continue
with the examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Mr. Martin, I have been asking you about some of your contractual
and financial arrangements with Marina Oswald and also Mr. Thorne's
and Robert Oswald's. If you and your counsel won't object I would like to
depart from that because I would like to have this information developed when
some of the members of the Commission are here who might not be at other
times during your examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. One thing Mr. Leech brought to my attention was that he
thought maybe you might be under the impression that these contracts were
all drawn on the same date, December 5. They weren't drawn on the same date.
I think it was the 5th, 6th and 7th, or the 5th, 6th, and 9th. Robert's was
drawn on the 9th, mine was drawn the 6th, and Mr. Thorne's was drawn the
5th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>I want to ask you about a particular incident that was referred to in the
Houston Post, an article in the paper and the source was given as you and
that is in regard to Mr. Nixon, Richard Nixon, former Vice President of the
United States.</p>

<p>Did Marina ever say anything to you about Lee Oswald planning any violent
action or assassination of Richard M. Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you first learn about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't remember the date. It was sometime in January, and
she mentioned it, said that he had come home one night and said, one evening,
and said that he had waited for Nixon to shoot him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What time was it that he came home that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't question her too much about the time. I assumed
that it was after work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. At about what time of the day was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Five or six o'clock. She said they were living on Neely Street,
and he came home that night, and told her about it. So the next morning
he got up, Nixon had not come into town, so he said that he would be in the
next day, and so he got up the next morning and got dressed with a suit, I
believe she said, and she locked him in the bathroom and kept him there all
day, they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she say how she locked him in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask her how she could do that, whether there was a
lock on the inside of the bathroom or outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I thought it was a little&mdash;I thought the story was a little
far-fetched myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I said, "Don't go around telling people something like
that."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she say anything about whether it was true or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said it was true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I ask a question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this brought up in connection with anything in particular
or just come out of the blue, blurted out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It just came out of the blue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. There was no prior conversation that led up to this or any
background to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not that I recall. It was just a statement that she made.
I think she was talking about <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was she prone to come out with these kinds of comments
or was this an unusual circumstance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She at times referred to some particular incident in
Russia or various things like that. And they would be completely unattached
to anything that we had been talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What more did you say to her about this incident when she
brought it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, the only time I recall Nixon being in Dallas was in
November. Now, she was not living with Oswald in November, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say that to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I just let the thing go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You didn't even ask her how she locked him in the bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I thought about it, because I know the only bathroom
doors I have seen lock from the inside and they swing in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you ask her what he did after he was locked in the
bathroom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did she say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said he didn't do anything. When she let him out that
night, and I suppose he would be pretty mad at her, and she said no, he
wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she say she kept him in the bathroom all day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Was anybody else present at the time of this statement
by her to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. My wife.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did your wife make any inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. We thought it was some kind of a story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You mean you thought it was an untrue story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, and why, I don't know. It didn't sound logical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Were there other conversations with Marina that you had
where you thought she was telling you things that were untrue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She would relate stories about Russia that I would listen to
but they didn't sound right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, they mostly dealt with boy friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did she say in that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, she would talk about some individual boy friends, usually a
non-Russian, someone from Rumania or Germany or from some other country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Is this going to be made public?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. This might be, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, I don't know about specific incidents. She would remark
about she knew&mdash;I am trying to think of a specific&mdash;one was, let's see, she
left Leningrad and went to Minsk because of an association with a married
man there.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. In Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was either she left Leningrad to go to Minsk or vice versa.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. But she left one or the other to go to the other because
of an association with a married man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Where was the association, in Leningrad or in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it was in the city that she left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. She was getting away from that association, was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. By going to the other city?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Do you recall any other conversation when she told you something
that you don't believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, she remarked about people that she knew in Russia that
had, we will say, <span class="locked">lovers&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she tell anything about a letter that she wrote to a boy
friend in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. After she was here in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What did she say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, she said she wrote the letter, and I believe what it
was she told the boy that she wasn't&mdash;she wanted to come back to Russia, to
him, she loved him, and the letter was returned, I believe, for lack of postage,
and Oswald got hold of the letter, and he asked her about it, and I think he
asked her either to read it or he would read it. I believe she read it to him.
This caused quite a bit of difficulty. Now, that is when she was in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When she was telling you about these people that had lovers
in Russia, you didn't believe these stories? Is that what you are saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, of course, I know nothing about Russian life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. So I more or less took it with a grain of salt. I didn't put any
credibility to it or any doubt to it. It was just something that was said and I
didn't either accept it or reject it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How did she happen to tell you about going to Minsk to get
away from a married man in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Tell us how that came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think she was just talking about boy friends, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she tell you she had quite a few boy friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was that in Russia that she had the boy friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. How many did she tell you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oh, boy. Well, she didn't mention any names as such, and I
don't know whether different stories got confused to being two different people
or&mdash;I would say 10 or 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she include Lee Oswald among those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, you mean as a boy friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did she tell you anything about her relations with these boy
friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You say you didn't believe these stories?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I didn't have any reason to disbelieve or to believe them.
They were just conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Now, on the Nixon matter, when that came to your attention,
did you tell anyone else about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I discussed it with my wife, and with John Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Excuse me just a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, this is Congressman Boggs, a member of the Commission, and
this is Mr. Leech, counsel for Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. I know Mr. Boggs, I met him in New Orleans years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Will you tell us about the conversation when you related this
to someone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was on the telephone, and I was quite shocked at first about
it and then thinking it over, it didn't sound logical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. You believed it at first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. I guess I didn't see any reason for it not to be true. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
then I didn't see any reason for it to be a lie, either, and I supposed it was
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. When did you tell Mr. Thorne about it with reference to when
Marina told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The same day. I don't recall the date at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. What did you say to Mr. Thorne about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I just related the incident, what she had told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say anything to him about telling the Commission about
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did he say anything about telling the Commission about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Was there anything else said in this telephone conversation
with Mr. Thorne except relating what Marina had said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I remarked what a big bombshell that would be as far as publicity
was concerned if the newspapers ever got hold of something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. That it would be helpful in regard to Marina's story, did you
say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I did think it would be harmful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>. Did you say that to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Why would it be harmful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, this purportedly took place after the Walker incident, and
she had made a statement that if Oswald repeated anything of a similar nature
as the Walker incident she would turn him over to the police, and this was a
repeat or similar, he actually didn't shoot at him but threatened to, and she did
not report it to the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I see.</p>

<p>The Walker incident took place on April 10, 1963, according to our records.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I would like you if you can to repeat everything that
Mrs. Oswald told you about the Nixon incident. What did Lee say to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This has been a very confusing 2 <span class="locked">months&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. To me.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Do the best you can. Take your time and tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I couldn't recall it verbatim, but she said he came in one evening,
early in the evening, and said that he had tried to shoot Nixon but that he had
not come into town that night as he was supposed to have, or that day, but that
he would be in the next day, and he would take care of it then.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you said that she did at least partly identify the
time by saying at the time they were living on Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Neely Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. May I just add there our records indicate they were living on
Neely Street on March 2, between March 2, 1963, and April 24, 1963.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald tell you anything that he said about the
way or means he intended to kill him or at what place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall what weapon she mentioned at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know if I recall that she said shoot him or kill him.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Could she speak English well enough to differentiate
between shoot and kill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At the time?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She could distinguish English that well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she mention a pistol or rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she mention whether he was employed at the time or unemployed
at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ask her how it was possible for her to keep him in a
bathroom for one whole day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you ask her why Lee Harvey Oswald wanted to kill Nixon,
any motive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think I asked, "Well, why would he want to do that?" And she
shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I would like to follow up on that. In this conversation with
her, did he give any reason to Marina Oswald why he wanted to kill Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Evidently not. She didn't answer. She didn't answer me when
I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, you have said in your opinion the Nixon incident
was after the Walker incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, that is what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she relate it to the General Walker incident in any way when
she discussed the Nixon incident with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She just said it was after General Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she relate to you any conversation that she may have had
with Lee Harvey Oswald relating the Nixon incident to the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she refer to any promise that he may have made at the
time of the Walker incident that may have related to the Nixon incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I remember her saying after the Walker incident she told
him that if he ever did anything of that nature again that she would report
him to the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. How did you know the Nixon incident was after or supposed to
be after the Walker incident? Did she say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. She said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; I asked when it happened and she said after Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When she told you that she had threatened Lee Oswald with
going to the police if there were another incident, did you ever ask her why
she had not done so in light of the Nixon incident which subsequently followed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I must not have because I think I would have remembered it if
I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever consider reporting the Nixon incident to any Federal
authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. If it didn't come out in the hearing, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When Mrs. Oswald was preparing to come to Washington with
you for the hearings before this Commission, did you discuss the Nixon incident
with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't think so. I know I told her to be sure to tell the truth to
the Commission. She had mentioned that she had lied to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. With regard to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. On a Mexico trip. She told the FBI she didn't know he had gone
there or that he was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To the best of your knowledge had she ever related the Nixon
incident to the FBI or Secret Service prior to her trip to Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't know. I was never in on any of the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you give her any advice in connection with any of those
interviews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I told her if she got tired to tell them so that they
could come back the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You say when she was planning to come here you advised
her to tell the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you give her similar advice in connection with the FBI
and Secret Service interviews?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't think the situation ever arose. She asked specifically
about the Mexico incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Throughout the many interviews with the FBI and Secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
Service you never asked her, I take it, whether she had discussed the Nixon
incident with the FBI or the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think I may have asked her when she told me, if she had
told the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't recall if I said anything.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Mr. Redlich. I wonder if we couldn't have Mr. Martin
tell us the time of day and the circumstances that this conversation with
Marina in the presence of your wife arose, not necessarily the date but
the time of day, and the <span class="locked">overall&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was in the evening.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. You were sitting around the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, in the den.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Just the three of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she just start talking or did you prompt her
or just how did the situation arise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't recall. I think maybe&mdash;I think it just came into conversation
as we were talking about the whole thing in general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Were you talking at that time about what her memoirs or
any writings she <span class="locked">might&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. &mdash;she might produce would include?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. What was your wife's reaction to this story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she couldn't believe it either.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she ask any questions about it such as the ones
you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, other than the ones I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us with whom you have discussed the Nixon
incident other than those that you have mentioned thus far, I believe thus
far you have said Mrs. Martin and Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>Is there anyone else you have told this to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Don Levine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Levine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. A writer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. For what publication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He is an author.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Freelance writer and author, Isaac Don Levine for the
record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When did you relate this incident to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Back in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us why you told him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He is of the opinion that there is more to this than meets
the eye, so to speak. He <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. More to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. More to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The Nixon story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The whole assassination, Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And he&mdash;of course, he is quite familiar with Russian affairs,
and he said the stories just don't match, and he was trying to tie in Oswald,
I guess, with the Communist Party or some attachment there some
place, and I mentioned that I thought he was just a nut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That who was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Oswald. And I said, I told him I didn't know how true it
was but then I related the story, and he&mdash;I cautioned him not to pass it
around or anything like that, which he said he wouldn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you or Marina Oswald compensated in any way for
the release of this information to Mr. Levine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was Mr. Levine at this time trying to get the rights to the
story or the right to write the story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He wants to write the story, and through Meredith Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you negotiating with Mr. Levine at the time concerning
the rights to Marina Oswald's story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And it was during the course of these negotiations that you
revealed to him the Nixon incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And this, you say, was sometime in January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you tell anyone else other than Mr. Levine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not that I recall unless it was Robert Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Will you try to refresh your recollection with regard to
Robert?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall whether you had a conversation in mid-January
with Robert Oswald concerning the Nixon incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't remember. I was trying to remember that the other
day to find out if I had mentioned it to him. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall when Robert Oswald would come to visit your
house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. On Sundays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And what would he do on these Sundays?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Usually take Marina and the baby to the cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall whether on one of those Sundays you had a conversation
with him concerning the Nixon incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't remember. I am not sure whether I did tell him or not.
It seems to me that I did, but I can't recall the incident at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Mrs. Oswald, Marina Oswald, ever indicate to you that
she had discussed the Nixon incident with anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To be more specific, did she ever indicate to you whether she
had discussed the Nixon incident with Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. With Mrs. Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. With any Federal authority?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you state again what your advice to her was with regard
to the revealing of this incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I told her it would be advisable just not to say anything
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. To anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But you related the incident to Mr. Levine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you accompanied Mrs. Oswald to Washington for the
hearings before this Commission, did the Nixon incident come up at all during
your conversations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. This incident which you regarded of such importance at the
time you didn't discuss with her at all during the time she was appearing before
this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't remember mentioning it to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You didn't ask her whether she had told the Commissioners?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think I asked John Thorne if she had mentioned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did Mr. Thorne say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He said no, not yet. And I dropped it at that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You and Mr. Thorne didn't have any conversations concerning
whether she should mention it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the conclusion of the testimony did you ask Mrs. Oswald
whether she had mentioned it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to my knowledge, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you discuss with Mr. Thorne the question of whether
she had mentioned the Nixon incident before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did Mr. Thorne say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you and Mr. Thorne discuss whether she should have
mentioned that incident before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you think it was an important incident, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I don't know why&mdash;the credibility of it didn't sound logical.
It didn't seem to me that it actually happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you speak to any representative of the Houston Post or
the Associated Press with regard to this incident in the last several days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us the nature of that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He came out and asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Who is "he"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, his name is Creighton, I believe or the last name began
with a "C", he is with the Houston Post, reporter. He came out and asked
me what I knew about the Nixon incident and I said I know nothing about it.
He said well he had it on good authority that there was a diary that Lee Harvey
Oswald had written and it was mentioned in the diary.</p>

<p>Now, I have never heard of a diary involved. There are some 60 pages of
manuscript that he is supposed to have written, but I have never heard of a
diary.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;which I told him.</p>

<p>He asked me if I knew of anyone that he could contact to find more about it.
And I said well, if anybody knows about it, it will be the Commission, and
I told him that I had just heard about it the day before, and he asked if Marina
knew anything about it, and I said I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You didn't discuss with this reporter whether you believed the
incident to be true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At the time you first learned about the incident you thought
it was of sufficient importance that you called Mr. Thorne the same day, isn't
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. We discussed it back and forth and I don't&mdash;we couldn't
think of how it could happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Could we go off the record?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Read this brief report into the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to read into the record a story which appears in the
Washington Post February 22, 1964&mdash;27, 1964, dated Houston, Texas, February 26,
Associated Press:</p>

<p>"The Houston Post quoted an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald's widow tonight
as saying Oswald planned to kill former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. The
Post quoted James Martin, until a few days ago Marina Oswald's business representative,
as saying that evidence to this effect had been presented to the
Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Martin is scheduled to testify before the Commissioners Thursday. Nixon
was in Dallas the day before President Kennedy was killed. Oswald was charged
with the slaying."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Now. I did not tell him&mdash;I told him exactly what I told you,
that I had no knowledge of it. I had secondhand knowledge only of it. I said
if anyone knew about it the Commission would know it.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you tell him that this evidence had been presented before
the Warren Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I told him if anybody knew about it, you would know about it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. I think you said a minute ago that you only learned about it
the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That is what I told the newspaper reporter.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What is the significance of that? Did you talk to somebody
the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, it was just a method of brushing him off.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Had you talked to Robert Oswald the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. May I ask this: Now, Mrs. Marina Oswald told you about the
Nixon incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Had she previously told you about the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, after it came out in the newspapers. The first I heard about
it was when I read in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Then she talked to you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I asked her about it.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You have read somewhere, have you, that Mrs. Marina Oswald
said that Lee Oswald gave her his reason for wanting to shoot at General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The reason she gave me was that Lee Harvey Oswald thought
that General Walker was a Fascist.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. And needed to be killed.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she tell you any statement that Lee Oswald made giving
his reasons that he wanted to kill or shoot Richard Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Didn't talk about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she ever tell you of any other statements that Lee Oswald
had made to her about his, any attempts that he made or any intentions that he
had to kill any other person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You are sure of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Positive.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. Did she tell you about any statements that Lee Oswald might
have made about President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. Anything <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. You must have talked to her a great deal about this assassination
of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Actually, I tried to avoid most of this stuff.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I tried to avoid most of these things. I don't know, I figured
they would be a sore spot with her, but I don't know whether they were or not.</p>

<p>Senator <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>. It would be tremendously helpful to this Commission to know
if she did talk to you about the assassination of President Kennedy and anything
that Lee Oswald might have said about him before and tell us <span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. If she had said anything to me about it I would definitely tell
you. I cannot recall any incident that&mdash;of the conversation between she and
Lee about any other assassination or about the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Had you ever met or heard of Lee Harvey Oswald prior to November
22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mrs. Oswald lived in your home for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About 2½ months.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. You had many conversations with her in that period
of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, not really many. I was usually out of the house, and there
weren't many opportunities that arose to have a conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did you ever have any reason to believe that she was
anything other than what she appeared to be, namely an ordinary housewife who
had come to this country as the wife of an American whom she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Looking back on the whole picture, she doesn't seem quite right.
I mean she doesn't fit.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. As a mother and a housewife. She is too cold for one thing.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Cold in what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Emotionally. This thing, I don't know whether it is the Russian
woman or what, but this thing would have terrifically upset an American woman,
and she was not very upset at all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Not upset about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About her husband.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. About her husband's subsequent death?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Well <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She was to a degree. But it didn't ring true.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. So what do you mean by that. Do you mean that because
of her coolness under very terrific&mdash;very difficult conditions and a very
difficult situation, that maybe she was not just what she appeared to be, and if
not, what do you think she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have no idea. It is the way she treated, the way she treated
contributions, for instance; someone would send a dollar, I don't know, maybe
it was her last dollar, and she would look at it and throw it aside and say,
"Oh, it is just a dollar." And John Thorne and I kind of built up an image
for her or of her, for the American public, and she is not exactly as we picture
her in the news articles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you spell that out in more detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, for one thing, I recall instances that she read the Bible
every day, she didn't crack a Bible. She got up between 10 and 11 o'clock every
morning. The only household chores she did was wash the evening dinner dishes,
and occasionally she would vacuum.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. This may be attributed to lack of energy or laziness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, yes, that is true. But she is not a humble person at all.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did you ever see her cry or show any comparable
emotions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. The closest I ever saw her to really showing any emotion
at all was when, it was about a week after she had been there, she saw a picture,
of Jackie Kennedy's picture&mdash;a picture of Jackie Kennedy, I don't know whether
it was Life Magazine or what.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did she ever do anything or say anything that would
give you any reason to believe that maybe she was part of an intelligence system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. Although I have wondered about it since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Since when, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, this whole thing, since I got into it. This whole thing
seems to me like I have been kind of made a patsy. Robert Oswald wouldn't
take her in right after this incident because he was afraid of what might happen,
might or might not happen.</p>

<p>The Fords also expressed the same opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What do you mean by the same opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That they wouldn't have taken her in at first. Mr. Ford expressed
the opinion that he was afraid of what the public reaction might be
and he didn't know what to think.</p>

<p>We took her in with the full knowledge that anything could happen, and anything
might happen, and it was done strictly on an altruistic basis at first, and
then this manager thing came in which I wish it hadn't at all.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, it has happened, and things have been turned upside
down.</p>

<p>But then as soon as the Secret Service was pulled off then Robert insisted
that she move from my home to his home, and start proceedings to cancel the
contracts that are in existence. She was up there&mdash;she came back to the doctor
on a Tuesday after she left our home, and stopped in at the house and said she
wanted to come back to live with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. When was this approximately? Just after she moved to the
Fords or how long after she moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, she left my home on Sunday, went to Denton to live with
Robert, came back to the doctor, Dr. Bishop, on Tuesday, and came over to the
house to pick up some of her belongings, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Excuse me, just so the Commission has the date straight, the
Sunday you are referring to when she left is the Sunday after her appearance
before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. That would be the 9th of February, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Then on Tuesday, which would be the 11th, she came back to the house, and
wanted to move back in.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Who drove her, how did she get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Vada Oswald, Robert Oswald's wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Are you finished with what you were about to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It just seemed strange to me that a sudden move should be made
like that and then within two days after that, it was Tuesday, and Wednesday,
Thursday and I received a letter from her discharging me as her manager or
attempting to discharge me.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. I was asking you about intelligence and that sort of
thing.</p>

<p>This would not indicate that sort of thing to you, would it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, but the whole thing seemed to be a kind of a preplanned
thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Will you spell that out in more detail because when Congressman
Boggs asked you questions as to whether Mrs. Oswald might be part of
Soviet intelligence you replied you are now beginning to wonder, and you also
replied you wonder if you have been made a patsy.</p>

<p>Could you, in your own words, explain that answer in greater detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of course, not knowing how a spy would work or anything, I
have no knowledge of anything of this sort, this whole thing shows a lack of
gratefulness or something, and actually she showed the same thing with Mrs.
Paine. She lived with Mrs. Paine for quite some time. Then Mrs. Paine has
been trying to contact her consistently for, well, ever since the assassination,
and we have passed letters to her, letters from Mrs. Paine to Marina, wherein
she has asked Marina to at least call her or do something, and Marina doesn't
want to have anything to do with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has Marina given you a reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said she doesn't like her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know why it was that Robert Oswald advised her not
to go back to the Paines or did you know that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I knew that he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you know the reason for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. He said he just didn't like her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He gave no reasons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And Mrs. Oswald, Marina Oswald, gave no reason to you as to
why she didn't like the Paines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I think it is because Robert didn't. That is a thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You said <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She has expressed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You said that you were beginning to wonder whether this is a
preplanned affair. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I don't mean preplanned from the very beginning, but I
think probably sometime in December from then on it might have been planned.</p>

<p>We have accumulated for her a considerable amount of money in story rights.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. How much?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, on advances, this is not the ultimate or the end result, but
just on advances, it is $132,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, you are reading from a document. Is that <span class="locked">something&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This I brought for you. We don't have the money. But these
are the contracts that have been negotiated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is this something you are turning over to the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, that is for your information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. What is the nature of this document?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It is a <span class="locked">handwritten&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. By me, a handwritten list of the publishers, and the news media
that I have contacted in Marina's behalf to sell her movie rights, the TV right,
book rights and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And the amount they have proposed to pay for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, these are just the advances.</p>

<p>Now, in the case of Texitalia Films, for <span class="locked">instance&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could I interrupt and get this identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. With your permission, we would like to introduce this into
evidence and take, a photostatic copy and leave you with the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you describe this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. This document lists various publications, media of communication,
and indicating the amounts which have been the subject of negotiation, and
the contracts, if any, which have been signed with these various media of
publication concerning Marina Oswald's story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Mr. Martin has said this is written in his own hand, is that
correct, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have to go to a meeting at the Speaker's
office momentarily, I would just like to ask one further question of this witness.</p>

<p>Now, I understand about the business negotiations here and so forth, but I
want you to be specific&mdash;anything that comes to your mind as to whether or not
this woman, anything more than what I asked you about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Can you give us about two minutes in that room?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Just one minute. This should go in the record.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Who is this individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have been trying to remember his name. I can find out his
name. It began with an "H".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Would you repeat the story, please, and then we will continue
with the examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I met a gentleman who is an executive with the Dinkler Hotel
chain, and he related the story to me that was told to him by one of their engineers,
a maintenance man in the Atlanta, in their Atlanta hotel. The maintenance
man's wife was an, or is a long distance telephone operator, and on the
night preceding the assassination there was an individual that called, well, the
way I heard the story, that she said he sounded like he had been drinking, and
that he mentioned to her to remember this telephone call because it would go
down in history. He made a credit card call to Lee Harvey Oswald, and
simply said, "Proceed as planned."</p>

<p>Then he made another telephone call to Jack Ruby and told him that if anything
went wrong he knew what to do.</p>

<p>Now, I questioned this, I guess there are numerous rumors of this type or
whatever it is, and he said no, that it was definitely the truth, and the reason
she hadn't come out before with it was that it is a violation of Federal law to
listen to a long distance telephone call, and that they finally did report it to the
FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The person you were speaking to, as I understand this story,
received the information from a maintenance man whose wife was the telephone
operator who overheard the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Was this a telephone operator in a Dinkler hotel?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't get that whether it was in a Dinkler hotel or whether she
was in the long distance or toll offices in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did this person have the credit card number and so
forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. The person that I was talking to?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Did the telephone operator have it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The telephone operator did, or the telephone company has the
records.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Do you have any other information that would indicate
<span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I know this doesn't indicate anything about Marina as far
as&mdash;no, it is just a strange feeling as far as Marina is concerned. She is too
cold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When did you hear about this story, Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About a week ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You haven't discussed it at all with Marina in that week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to question you again on Congressman Boggs point.
You have said she is too cold, you have said you thought that all this was preplanned.
Is there anything specific in anything that she told you or in any of
her actions which would lead you to believe that she has withheld certain information
from you, or this Commission, concerning her knowledge about the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, except she made a remark to me one time that she didn't
volunteer anything. She only answered questions.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. This was after the return from the Commission hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, this was sometime ago. That was <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Before the Commission hearing where she appeared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. And it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is that all you had on this particular point?</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Boggs</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I don't remember what brought it up even. She didn't like the
FBI. She said that. And she didn't like to answer questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she tell you why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She just didn't like them. Boguslav in particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. But her remark was made before her hearing before this
Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. And did not relate then to that hearing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she indicate to you she had revealed everything that there
was to reveal before this Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. There again I didn't question her about anything that she
said in the Commission. I didn't feel it was any of my business for one thing,
and all I asked her is how it went, and she would say fine, and that would be
the end of it. That is the limit of my questioning her as far as testimony within
the Commission was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Will you tell us how you found out about the General Walker
incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Read it from the newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When you read about it did you talk to Mrs. Oswald about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you tell us the nature of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I asked her if it was true, and she said yes, and I also
asked her who was with Oswald, and she said no one. He did things alone.
And, let's see, she related the story as to the note he had written. He had left
earlier in the evening, and he hadn't come home at the, we'll say, at an early
hour, and she was getting quite upset with him, and she found this note on a
bed table or somewhere in the bedroom, and read it, and it simply said that he
might be gone for a time or he might be in jail, and instructions as to what to
do in case he was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did Marina tell you all about this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. She knew English well enough to be able to relate this type of
story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She learned very rapidly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. It was the same day it came out in the paper.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. Did she know of her own knowledge about General
Walker? Did she indicate any background information about General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Representative <span class="smcap">Ford</span>. She only told what Lee told her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Lee told her he was a Fascist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she recount to you, that is, did Marina account to you, what
she said to Lee Harvey after this incident, after the Walker incident, after he
told her about the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, she said that she hid the note that he left in a cookbook and
told him if he ever did anything like that again that she would turn that note
over to the police and turn him over to the police also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, were you aware that Marina Oswald had given
this information voluntarily to the Secret Service or the FBI concerning the
Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever ask her about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, it was in the newspapers so I assumed they knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. And you assumed she had volunteered this information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, of course now, I was a little concerned to begin with as to
how it got out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Why were you concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, if she had told it to the FBI and the FBI only then how
did it get in the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What was the&mdash;you say you were concerned that certain aspects
of her story were being released. What was the nature of your concern?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I was just wondering how that information got to the
newspapers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ask her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, I didn't ask her because she didn't see any newspaper reporters
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ask any of the agents of the FBI or the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, Mr. Heitman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What did Mr. Heitman tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He said it didn't come from the Dallas office. He said it must
have come from Washington. The Houston Chronicle brought it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By Washington he meant the Washington office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of the FBI, the Justice Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. FBI. That was his opinion as to where this information could
come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you ever ask Mrs. Oswald why she had not revealed this
information prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. I tried to stay as far away from this investigation as possible,
because I didn't want to get into it at all to be real frank about it. I
figured there are people better equipped than I to ferret out information and
they have methods of doing it that I have no idea about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At that time, however, you were acting as her business representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. Because I had to refute something in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Were you assisting her at that time in the preparation of any
narratives that she was preparing in connection with her story?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. She has never written anything other than the manuscript
that she wrote for the Commission. And we have never pre-prepared anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Has she had conversations with others, to your knowledge, who
have been writing material, Isaac Don Levine, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The only one would be Levine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. The only one would be Isaac Don Levine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Levine told me she told him that her husband was a Trotskyite.
Now what that means, I don't know but he seemed to think quite a bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Marina told Isaac Don Levine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. That Marina's husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Lee Oswald was a Trotskyite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. He was a Trotskyite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, in what way do you consider yourself a patsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, because this, for <span class="locked">instance&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. May we introduce this in evidence so we know what we are
talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I <span class="locked">offer&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Identify it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In the course of the witness' explanation of his business representation
of Mrs. Oswald the witness has presented before this Commission a
list of arrangements that he has entered into or is considering entering into
concerning the sale of certain aspects of Mrs. Oswald's story. This document is,
we are told, written in Mr. Martin's handwriting. I show the witness Commission
Exhibit No. 325 and ask you whether this document is one that you have
brought before the Commission and whether its contents are as I have described
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Chairman, I ask that Commission Exhibit No. 325 be
admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It shall be admitted.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 325 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. It is understood that a photostat of this exhibit will be made
part of the permanent record of the Commission, and that the original will be
returned to the witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I wonder if you wouldn't leave us the original in this case because
this was prepared for the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. You can have the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. We will keep the original and we will be glad to give you a
photostat for your records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have it right up here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Do you want to read that into the record, it is quite short and it
might make the record more intelligible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Since this is in the handwriting of the witness may I suggest
that the witness read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Texitalia Films, $75,000 movie and the TV rights, World Wide

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, it is in connection with this document that you
have referred to yourself as a possible patsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could I ask just one moment before that, how much has been
received and how much <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. $50,000 of it. The rest is being held, $75,000 in Texitalia Films
they have the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Who is they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Texitalia Films. But they don't want to part with it until this
is settled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Until what is settled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Until there is an amicable settlement between Marina Oswald
and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Concerning your representation of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You mean they are holding their own money and not paying it
at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. It hasn't been put in escrow or anything of that kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. We have received $5,000 from Life Magazine. That is
in an escrow account. I have a check for $2,400 from Stern Magazine, which
is uncashed because the attorney McKenzie who has been hired by Robert
wrote a letter to Stern Magazine saying that I had no authority to make any
deals for Marina. So they stopped payment on the check. Of course, I haven't
tried to cash the check, so it is sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. At this time, rather than go into the details of these business
arrangements, I would like to revert to the question posed earlier in connection
with this document, you referred to yourself as a patsy.</p>

<p>Would you care to explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I have put in approximately 2½; months of good, hard work
and grief trying in the first place, trying to keep the news media away from her
and at the same time trying to sell her story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Don't assume we know anything, tell us everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I had to leave my job at the Inn of the Six Flags to properly
handle this which was the first of the year. I could not keep going on both
jobs. These contracts were negotiated on the basis of my contract with her,
which states that I have full power to sign any contracts for her in these fields.</p>

<p>William McKenzie, who is, was hired, apparently, by Robert Oswald, and is
acting in his behalf, I guess, although he is using Marina Oswald's name, has
tried to cancel my contract retroactively, in other words, just like it was never
there at all, and it just happened too suddenly for it not to have been planned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What would have been planned? What is the plan that you
suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, the dropping of it&mdash;as soon as the money starts to come in,
then the first thing they want to do is get rid of the personal manager and the
attorney who has been taking all, who have been the buffers for the 2½; months
prior to that.</p>

<p>The Secret Service was pulled off, there is apparently no danger at all concerning
her life or anyone connected with her. So they feel perfectly safe in
taking off, carrying on where we left off, utilizing all the work that we had put
into it.</p>

<p>This was not a decision that was made in two days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you be more specific in terms of your suspicions with
regard to the plan which you have alleged here was designed to get you off
this job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I have letters from&mdash;one from Marina and one from McKenzie,
that requests my discharge from this contractual agreement.</p>

<p>Now they have actually no reason to cancel the contract. I have performed
as far as these sales are concerned quite well, and, of course, those are just
advance payments of $132,000. There would be more on royalties after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did you sign these agreements or Mr. Thorne or did Marina
sign them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. These agreements with the news media?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You signed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. According to the contract that I have with Marina, "You will
authorize me and approve for and in my behalf and in your discretion and
decision the following: approve and permit the use of my name, photographs,
likeness, voice, sound effects, characters, persons for all publicity, advertising
and the promotion of any and all ventures desired by you to be undertaken by
me and for the performance by me of any appearance or service. You are
authorized, empowered and directed by me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. I think we have a copy of this, do we not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes. You are reading <span class="locked">from&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. My contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes, just so the record is clear, the contract between James
Martin and Marina Oswald is Commission Exhibit 276 which was introduced
in connection with Robert Oswald's testimony. Mr. Martin, there has been
introduced in a prior hearing what is now Commission Exhibits Nos. 274 and 275,
a letter from William McKenzie to you and a letter from William McKenzie
to Mr. Thorne concerning the discharging of your services.</p>

<p>Do you have any document which you wish to introduce at the present time
concerning that&mdash;the reasons given for your discharge, because I would like
to ask you questions concerning that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. May I ask the date of the letter please, sir? Give me the date.
I think we have the originals, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. There is one dated February 18, two of them dated February 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Yes, one to Jim Martin and one to Mr. John Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. One is addressed to Mr. James Martin and the other to Mr.
John Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. Yes, sir; we have the originals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have with you any other letters in connection with the
termination of Mr. Martin's services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. One from Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, you said earlier in your testimony that you were
building a public image of Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you tell the Commission what you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, in this type of <span class="locked">thing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. May I interrupt and suggest you don't thumb <span class="locked">through&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Excuse me. We were trying to create in the public mind an
image of a bereaved widow and a simple lost girl. And I think we did actually.
This was for her, as I say, for her benefit. She has received some $68,000 in
contributions, and the image is not all true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you tell us in respect to which in your opinion the image
is not true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, as I mentioned before about the bible, this is a very small
incident, she has received numerous bibles in the mail, and to my knowledge has
never read the first page of one, and most of them are in Russian.</p>

<p>This is a small thing really but it is part of her image, that she is a religious
person.</p>

<p>She wants to be thought of as we have built her now but she doesn't conform
to that image.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In what way, how?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she is lazy, for one thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Lazy in what respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, as far as even taking care of the children. The children
bother her. I mean to her they are a constant upset. When she left our home
to go up to Denton, my wife offered to keep the baby there at the house if she
liked, and Marina took her up on it and then Robert told her she had better
take the baby with her. She hadn't seen the baby for over a week. And the
first day she was back she was willing to leave the baby again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is there anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Her lack of, well, humbleness as far as all these contributions
are concerned. She takes it as a matter of&mdash;she takes it for granted. She is
quite unhappy when the contributions slack off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has she discussed the amount of contributions with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I have kept her informed all along on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Has she indicated that there is some relationship between the
story that she reveals to the public and the contributions which she will receive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you be more specific about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she has read newspaper articles, for instance, that I haven't
written but I have directed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Directed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. By giving them information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What is the <span class="locked">nature&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. To build it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What is the nature of these articles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I recall one, I wonder if I have it, I guess I don't have it,
that was written by Bill Burrus of the Times Herald in Dallas. It was a very
good article, and not quite true, we will say. It is shaded in truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have the article with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Here is one Bill Burrus did that is when she went to midnight
mass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin has submitted to the Commission an article which
does not carry a date or the name of the publication in which it appears, but is
headed "Marina Oswald attended mass, had quiet Yule", by Bill Burrus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That was the Dallas Times Herald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Since we would like to question the witness about this, I would
like to label it Commission Exhibit No. 326 and ask it be introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. It will be admitted with no objection.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 326 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I hand you Commission Exhibit 326, Mr. Martin. Will you
tell us in what respects this article is not true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I wouldn't say it is strictly not true. But it embellishes
the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you be specific in terms of references to the particular
article?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, for instance, let's see, is this where she went to church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she go to church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Leech</span>. It is my partner's church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, for instance, "she wandered around the secret quarters
for long periods of time, sometimes she listened to Christmas carols over radio
or television", which I believe is not true. I don't believe I told that; that was
just added in there.</p>

<p>"Marina continued her studies of the English language and watched television,
including her favorite Steve Allen show". She doesn't even like Steve
Allen. And, of course, she is never studying English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Was this information that you gave to Mr. Burrus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. That is the trouble with newspapers. I have told Bill
Burrus that she watches Steve Allen. She does but just for lack of anything
else to do.</p>

<p>Now I didn't say anything about the Christmas carols nor about studying the
English language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You say she has not been studying the English language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, she is learning it quite rapidly because she had to in her
own defense in order to converse with people. When she was living with us,
there was no one there that spoke Russian so she had to learn English in order
to converse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Is there anything else in this particular article that you would
either regard as unslanted or untrue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Could you give us other examples <span class="locked">where&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There is the first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. If you are planning to comment on that I would like to introduce
it in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. This will go with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. The witness has submitted to the Commission an article appearing
in the Dallas Times Herald on Sunday, December 15, 1963, the headline
reading, "Marina Oswald, all the pity in the world won't help", written by
Bill Burrus. This has now been marked as Commission Exhibit No. 327, and I
ask that it be admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. This will be admitted, if there is no objection.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Commission Exhibit No. 327 for
identification and received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Mr. Martin, I hand you Commission Exhibit No. 327 and ask
you to tell the Commission in what respects if any there is material in this
article which you regard as untrue or exaggerated or slanted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Here is a sentence in here, "She pores over the letters reaching
her more than a thousand so far and is choked with emotion by the compassion
and support they express", the only thing she did actually was to open the
letters and did not open all of them. The only letters she read or attempted to
read were ones written in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. What was her reaction to those letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Acceptance of it but no real thankfulness. The further it went,
the longer it went, it seemed the less she cared <span class="locked">whether&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did Burrus get this slanted material from you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall anything she specifically said in response to these
letters that is leading you to the conclusion that you have reached?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That she specifically said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, for instance, one day she opened a letter and there was
a dollar in it and she said, "Oh, a dollar", and threw it on the table, and there
are little things that living as closely as we did, you can't really recall the
specific incidents but there is a general feeling, and there is a complete lack
of compassion as to what all these people are doing for her or trying to do for
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But you can't recall anything specific that she said which
would indicate this lack of compassion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, other than "the American people are crazy for sending me
that money".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is that a quotation from Mrs. Oswald? She said the American
people are crazy for sending this money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she elaborate on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did you reply to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I told her that they felt sorry for her and she didn't say
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she make any other comments of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Other than that dollar bill. Those are the only ones I can
remember specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Would you continue your examination of Commission Exhibit
No. 327?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, let's see, "unlike her husband, Marina is devout. She is
a member of the Greek Orthodox Church", that is not true. She was not a devout
Greek orthodox. She was not devout anything so far as religion is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she ever say anything about the baptism of her child in
that church to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, now let's see, she was supposed to have gotten June baptized
without her husband's knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. You say she was supposed to have, where did you get that
information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, I read it somewhere prior to this article. This article
has it in there. I didn't give him this information. He got it from some other
article, and I recall reading it. And when she read this, she commented on it.
She said he did know that June was being baptized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Did she read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. In English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. She knew English well enough to read this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes. It took her a while to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to call the <span class="locked">attention&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. This is December 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I would like to call the attention of the Commission to the date
which is Sunday, December 15. You say as of Sunday, December 15, which is
a little over 3 weeks after she came to live with you, Mrs. Oswald knew English
well enough to be able to read this and understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not to read it legibly, I mean not to understand every word of
it but she understood the biggest part of the article. I was quite amazed at how
much she could read. She can't read writing or says she can't, but she can read
printing or typing.</p>

<p>Here is another one now, "she is poring over children's primary readers
and studying the Russian-English dictionary attempting to understand all the
words and talk about her."</p>

<p>She had one child's book that one of the Secret Service men brought her, and
she looked at it and that was the end of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Where did this information appearing in this story come from?
Did you tell that to Mr. Burrus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. When Mrs. Oswald read this story and saw things that were
not quite true, did she discuss that fact with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. On one occasion, let's see, what was it&mdash;it may have been in this
article. Oh, yes, about the baptism. She said that Lee did know about the
baptism. This was gleaned from some place else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Before or afterward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, she said before. Before the baptism.</p>

<p>"She washes clothes for herself and June Lee, she cooks her own meals
favoring macaroni and other casserole dishes." She did not cook her own meals.
She cooked twice while she was at the house in two and a half months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Is this fact one which you related to Mr. Burrus, the fact she
cooked her own meals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I didn't say she cooked her own meals but she cooked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you recall what reaction if any Mrs. Oswald had in reading
this comment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. The only one she commented on was she doesn't like macaroni,
it is noodles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. But Mrs. Oswald voiced no objection to your giving this information
to the newspapers which to use your expression was not quite true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No. "Marina now has the first dish washer she has ever used
and she thinks it is wonderful". Actually, she didn't like it but now in most of
this stuff Bill Burrus would ask me a question like, "Does she have a dish
washer", and I would say "yes", and he would elaborate on it.</p>

<p>This is quite a sympathetic article. "Marina gets up at about 9 a.m. every
day." She always got up between 10 and 11. "She asked Secret Service men to
read some of the letters to her". I don't recall any incident where she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Was that also a fact which you gave to Mr. Burrus?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>"As the hours and days tick by Marina watches television and struggles
with newspapers. These things bring tears to her eyes, pictures of President
Kennedy, Jackie, Lee Oswald, Mrs. Tippit, the wife of the slain police
officer. Sometimes she turns off the set." That is not true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Could you be a little bit more specific about that? Were there
instances in which she saw these people mentioned and what was her
reaction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No real reaction at all. Just there on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. You started to describe earlier I think when she saw a picture
of Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy and she made certain remarks. I don't know
that we finished that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Well, yes; she did. She remarked, "Oh, Jackie, Jackie", and
that was it. There wasn't&mdash;kind of shook her head. That is in this article,
too, and that is true.</p>

<p>Of course, this last paragraph, "The agents speak through curtains and
she feels hunted sometimes despite friendly letters and packages". I don't
think she has ever felt hunted or in danger. She has expressed that opinion.
She didn't feel that anyone was&mdash;anyone intended to harm her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. Did she ever express any ideas about going back to the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. She said it once and I questioned her about it. She said she
was just&mdash;what was it&mdash;just joking. She used a funny sounding word for
joking. I don't remember what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. Do you have any further comments with regard to this
particular exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. I suggest this would be a good time for recess, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dulles</span>. All right. The Commission will be adjourned until 3 p.m.,
this afternoon.</p>

<p>Would you report with your counsel at that time?</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the President's Commission recessed.)</p>
